"This study proposed to investigate the thermal properties and subjective thermal discomfort of five virtual reality headsets, and their relationships. Twenty-seven university students used each of the five headsets for 45Â min. Microclimate temperature and relative humidity were measured by miniature dataloggers. Infrared thermography was used to measure temperature distribution on the contact points between user's face and the headsets. Participants reported subjective thermal discomfort associated with using each headset. The average microclimate temperature and relative humidity increased by 7.8Â Â°C and 3.5% respectively after headset use. Overall subjective thermal discomfort increased along with duration of use and came primarily from the display. Applying the linear mixed-effects model showed that subjective thermal discomfort is positively correlated with duration of use, microclimate temperature, relative humidity and display coverage area. Conversely, thermal discomfort is negatively correlated with total coverage area, with microclimate temperature acting as the most significant contributing factor. The headsets were ranked by pairing the objective measurements with subjective evaluations.","Virtual reality headsets, Thermal comfort, Microclimate",Zihao Wang and Renke He and Ke Chen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018304010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103066,0003-6870,2020,103066,85,Applied Ergonomics,Thermal comfort and virtual reality headsets,article,WANG2020103066
"A one-pedal system for operating an electric vehicle allows drivers to flexibly accelerate and decelerate (and even stop) by using just an accelerator pedal. Based on previous findings, one-pedal operation is considered to have the potential to increase positive emotions and decrease cognitive workload. To test this possibility, the present study compared the emotional state and cognitive workload between one-pedal and conventional two-pedal operation. Participants drove a vehicle on public roads, and driving enjoyment (i.e., pleasure and immersion) and the cognitive workload (i.e., ease and effortlessness) were assessed by means of questionnaires. In addition, physiological variations associated with driving pleasure and difficulty were assessed by electroencephalography (EEG). Both the questionnaire and EEG results revealed an increase in driving enjoyment in one-pedal operation. On the other hand, only the EEG results suggested a decrease in the cognitive workload in one-pedal operation; the questionnaire results did not show a significant difference between the pedal conditions. These findings support the notion that one-pedal operation has a positive influence on the driver's mental state, though its influence on the cognitive workload will require further investigation. We discuss future directions toward a better understanding of the effects of one-pedal operation on the driver's mental state.","One-pedal operation, Electric vehicle, Emotion, Workload, Attentional resources, Electroencephalogram",Fumie Sugimoto and Motohiro Kimura and Yuji Takeda and Motoyuki Akamatsu and Satoshi Kitazaki and Kazuo Yajima and Yonosuke Miki,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301332,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103179,0003-6870,2020,103179,88,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of one-pedal automobile operation on the driver's emotional state and cognitive workload,article,SUGIMOTO2020103179
"Surgery has changed significantly in recent years due to the introduction of advanced technologies, resulting in increased system complexity at the technical, human and organisational levels, which may lead to higher variability of patient outcome due to new error pathways. Current approaches towards a safer surgery are largely based on ex-post analysis of events and process monitoring (e.g. root cause analysis, safety checklists, safety audits). However, adopting a proactive approach enables the prior identification of critical factors and the design of safer sociotechnical systems, thanks to a multi-level (or mesoergnomics) perspective. In this paper, a methodology for performing mesoergonomics analysis of surgical procedures is proposed. It is a methodology for Dynamic Human Reliability Analysis in Robotic Surgery based on a modified version of human error assessment and reduction technique (HEART) integrated with a method for incorporating uncertainties related to the influence of personal and organisational factors on the execution of a surgical procedure. The pilot application involves a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy procedure, and the results reveal that team-related factors have the greatest impact on patient outcome variability.","Human reliability analysis (HRA), HEART, Dynamic event tree (DET), Healthcare, Robotic surgery",Rossella Onofrio and Paolo Trucco,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301058,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103150,0003-6870,2020,103150,88,Applied Ergonomics,A methodology for Dynamic Human Reliability Analysis in Robotic Surgery,article,ONOFRIO2020103150
"Truck platoon driving is a current branch of automated driving, which has the potential to radically change the work routine of professional drivers. In a platoon system, one truck (semi-)automatically follows a lead truck with a reduced distance, which produces significant savings in fuel and enables better traffic flow. In a current application of truck platoon driving, the following vehicle operates at level-2 automation. Thus, the driver of the following truck merely has to supervise the semi-automated system, which takes over steering and speed control when engaged. Level-2 truck platoon driving had not been tested with professional drivers in real traffic before. We hypothesized that user acceptance would improve after the experience of platoon driving. Quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews were conducted with 10 drivers before and after an extensive Autobahn experience. The results show a clear increase of acceptance after the experience. Platoon driving was evaluated to be more useful, easier to use, and safer after the experience. Besides perceived driving safety, the prestige of truck platooning, the perceived usefulness of the system, and general technology affinity co-determined user acceptance.","Truck platoon driving, Technology acceptance, Professional driver",Sarah-Maria Castritius and Heiko Hecht and Johanna MÃ¶ller and Christoph J.

"This paper presents a new handle for instruments used in laparoscopic surgery. This new handle has been designed to provide the best ergonomic and usability features required in this kind of surgical interventions. The main novelty of this handle is that the opening and closing motion of the end-effector is operated with the thumb using a lever located on the top of the handle. This enables the surgeon to reach the patient's organs without adopting extremely awkward postures. In order to demonstrate its advantages, the handle has been tested and compared with another commercial handle in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. To this end, volunteers have been selected for participation in the experimental evaluation, which comprised two types of surveys: objective and subjective. Electromyography and goniometric studies provide objective parameters for evaluation. Questionnaires are used for the subjective assessment. Outstanding results include the lower level of pain reported by the individuals working with the new handle, as well as the reduction in the hyperflexion of the wrist. Compared with the conventional handle, electromyography reveals that no muscle load is increased when working with the new handle. The results of the subjective survey show that volunteers expressed a significant preference for the new handle, demonstrating an improvement in the ergonomic characteristics.","Laparoscopic surgery, Handle design, Biomechanics",Ramon Sancibrian and Carlos Redondo-Figuero and Maria C.

"Occupants of autonomous vehicle have frequently indicated the desire to sleep or rest while driving, yet little has been known regarding the suitable design criteria for a biomechanically reasoned in-vehicle sleeping position. This study was aimed at evaluating the biomechanical quality of different backrest and seat pan angle combinations, and at predicting the most favourable sleeping positions based on vehicle restriction. More specifically, the interface pressure distribution and subjective suitability rating of 23 subjects was assessed in a total of nine (3Â Ã?Â 3) combinations of seat pan (20Â°, 30Â°, 40Â°) and backrest (145Â°, 155Â°, 165Â°) angles. Biomechanical quality was evaluated with an interface pressure score (IPS) based on sensitivity weighted pressures and the total contact area. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that IPS significantly improves with increasing seat pan angle whereas backrest angles of 155Â° or 165Â° lead to significant better IPS compared to flatter ones (145Â°). The overall highest IPS was observed for a 40Â°-seat pan angle in combination with a 155Â°-backrest angle. Subjective suitability rating revealed that people prefer a combination of 165Â° backrest angle with a seat pan of 20Â°; however, eight of nine combinations can be considered as suitable for sleeping. Therefore, the combination of a 40Â°-seat pan angle and 155Â° backrest is recommended by the present study for an in-vehicle sleeping position due to the increased biomechanical quality.","Autonomous driving, Automated driving, Sleeping posture, Seating, Seat design, Posture variation, Posture analysis, Interface pressure, Transportation, Biomechanics, Ergonomics",Maximilian J.

"Recently, several spinal exoskeletons were developed with the aim to assist occupational tasks such as load-handling and work in prolonged static postures. While the biomechanical effects of such devices has been well investigated, only limited feedback to the developers is usually provided regarding the subjective perceptions of the end-users. The aim of this study was to present a novel battery of tests, designed to assess functional performance and subjective outcomes during the use of assistive trunk exoskeletons, and to assess its test-retest reliability. The battery of tests consists of 12 different simple functional tasks. Twenty participants were included in an intra-session reliability test and repeated the tests within 7â??10 days to assess inter-session reliability. They were wearing a novel passive spinal exoskeleton during all trials. The outcomes included quantitative and subjective measures, such as performance time and rating of discomfort and perceived task difficulty. The majority of the outcome measures were reliable within session and between sessions (ICC or Î±Â >Â 0.80). Systematic effects were observed in a few tasks, suggesting that familiarization trials will be needed to minimize the learning effects. The novel battery of tests could become an important easy-to-use tool for functional testing of the spinal exoskeletons in addition to more specific biomechanical and physiological testing. Further studies should address the reliability of the present battery of tests for assessing specific populations, such as low back pain patients and explore how to minimize systematic effects that were observed in this study.","Robotics, Assistive device, Functional test, Trunk, Low back pain",Å½iga Kozinc and Saskia Baltrusch and Han Houdijk and Nejc Å arabon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300764,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103117,0003-6870,2020,103117,86,Applied Ergonomics,Reliability of a battery of tests for functional evaluation of trunk exoskeletons,article,KOZINC2020103117
"Visual-to-auditory sensory substitution devices (SSDs) provide improved access to the visual environment for the visually impaired by converting images into auditory information. Research is lacking on the mechanisms involved in processing data that is perceived through one sensory modality, but directly associated with a source in a different sensory modality. This is important because SSDs that use auditory displays could involve binaural presentation requiring both ear canals, or monaural presentation requiring only one â?? but which ear would be ideal? SSDs may be similar to reading, as an image (printed word) is converted into sound (when read aloud). Reading, and language more generally, are typically lateralised to the left cerebral hemisphere. Yet, unlike symbolic written language, SSDs convert images to sound based on visuospatial properties, with the right cerebral hemisphere potentially having a role in processing such visuospatial data. Here we investigated whether there is a hemispheric bias in the processing of visual-to-auditory sensory substitution information and whether that varies as a function of experience and visual ability. We assessed the lateralization of auditory processing with two tests: a standard dichotic listening test and a novel dichotic listening test created using the auditory information produced by an SSD, The vOICe. Participants were tested either in the lab or online with the same stimuli. We did not find a hemispheric bias in the processing of visual-to-auditory information in visually impaired, experienced vOICe users. Further, we did not find any difference between visually impaired, experienced vOICe users and sighted novices in the hemispheric lateralization of visual-to-auditory information processing. Although standard dichotic listening is lateralised to the left hemisphere, the auditory processing of images in SSDs is bilateral, possibly due to the increased influence of right hemisphere processing. Auditory SSDs might therefore be equally effective with presentation to either ear if a monaural, rather than binaural, presentation were necessary.","Dichotic listening, Blindness, Sensory substitution, Audiovisual, Ergonomics, Hemispheric lateralization",Michael J.

"Patient lateral transfers between two adjacent surfaces pose high musculoskeletal disorder risks for nurses and patient handlers. The purpose of this research was to examine the ergonomic benefits of utilizing the laterally-tilting function of operating room (OR) tables during such transfers â?? along with different friction-reducing devices (FRD). This method allows the patient to slide down to the adjacent surface as one nurse guides the transfer and another controls the OR table angle with a remote control. Sixteen nursing students and sixteen college students were recruited to act as nurses and patients, respectively. Two OR table angles were examined: flat and tilted. Three FRD conditions were considered: a standard blanket sheet, a plastic bag, and a slide board. Electromyography (EMG) activities were measured bilaterally from the posterior deltoids, upper trapezii, latissimus dorsi, and lumbar erector spinae muscles. The Borg-CR10 scale was used for participants to rate their perceived physical exertions. The efficiency of each method was measured using a stopwatch. Results showed that the tilted table technique completely replaced the physical efforts that would have been exerted by the pushing-nurse, in that muscle activation did not increase in the pulling-nurse. On the contrary, EMG activities of the pulling-nurse for most of the muscles significantly decreased (pÂ <Â 0.05). The subjective Borg-ratings also favored the tilted table with significantly lower ratings. However, the tilted table required on average 7.22Â s more than the flat table to complete the transfer (pÂ <Â 0.05). The slide board and plastic bag were associated with significantly lower Borg-ratings and EMG activities for most muscles than blanket sheet, but they both were not significantly different from each other. However, they each required approximately 5Â s more than the blanket sheet method to complete the patient transfer (pÂ <Â 0.05). By switching from flatÂ +Â blanket sheet to tiltedÂ +Â slide board, EMG activities in all muscles decreased in the range of 18.4â??72.3%, and Borg-ratings decreased from about 4 (somewhat difficult) to 1 (very light). The findings of this study propose simple, readily available ergonomic interventions for performing patient lateral transfers that can have significant implications for nursesâ?? wellbeing and efficiency.","Patient lateral transfer, Operating room table angle, Friction-reducing device, Ergonomics, Electromyography",Saif K.

"Physiological indicators, including eye tracking measures, may provide insight into human decision making and cognition in many domains, including weather forecasting. Situation awareness (SA), a critical component of forecast decision making, is commonly conceptualized as the degree to which information is perceived, understood, and projected into a future context. Drawing upon recent applications of eye tracking in the study of forecaster decision making, we investigate the relationship among eye movement measures, automation, and SA assessed through a freeze probe assessment method. In addition, we explore the relationship between an automated forecasting decision aid use and information seeking behavior. In this study, a sample of professional weather forecasters completed a series of tasks, informed by a set of forecasting decision aids, and with variable access to an experimental automated tool, while an eye tracking system captured data related to eye movements and information usage. At the end of each forecasting task, participants responded to a set of questions related to the environmental situation in the framework of a survey-based assessment technique in order to assess their level of situation awareness. Regression analysis revealed a moderate relationship between the SA measure and eye tracking metrics, supporting the hypothesis that eye tracking may have utility in assessing SA. The results support the use of eye tracking in the assessment of specific and measurable attributes of the decision-making process in weather forecasting. The findings are discussed in light of potential benefits that eye tracking could bring to human performance assessment as well as decision-making research in the forecasting domain.","Situation awareness, Human factors, Assessment, Eye tracking, Weather forecasting",Elizabeth M.

"The debate around skeuomorphic and flat designs has been long lasting and inconclusive, in part because of the lack of empirical evidence supporting the superiority of one or the other icon style from the perspectives of function and aesthetics. Therefore, this study investigated whether older and younger users perceive the aesthetics of icon styles in the same manner as designers and which style results in the most efficient visual search. Using an experimental system that we developed, 24 older and 24 younger participants rated and searched application icons belonging to the two styles. The results indicated that there was generally a notable difference between participants' and designers' perceptions of icon design styles, even after training, and that the perceived icon design styles further influenced the visual search time and accuracy of the participants as well as their evaluation of the iconsâ?? beauty. The results imply that the younger participants could use the skeuomorphic icons more efficiently than they could use the flat icons and that they had an advantage over older participants in terms of this ability; however, aesthetically they appreciated flat icons more. In contrast, older participants searched skeuomorphic icons more quickly and accurately than they did flat icons, and aesthetically they appreciated skeuomorphic icons more.","Skeuomorphic design, Flat design, Smartphone, Older adults, App icons, Visual search",Ruoyu Chen and Jincheng Huang and Jia Zhou,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018305751,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103073,0003-6870,2020,103073,85,Applied Ergonomics,Skeuomorphic or flat icons for an efficient visual search by younger and older adults?,article,CHEN2020103073
"The present study investigated effects of cognitive and visual loads on driving performance after take-over request (TOR) in an automated driving task. Participants completed automated driving in a driving simulator without a non-driving related task, with an easy non-driving related task, and with a difficult non-driving related task. The primary task was to monitor the environment and the system state. An N-back task and a Surrogate Reference Task (SuRT) were adapted to induce cognitive and visual loads respectively. The system followed a front vehicle automatically. Driving performance was measured by responses to a critical event (appearance of a broken-down car) after the automated system issued TOR and then terminated. High subjective difficulty of the N-back task was related to increased time and increased steering angle variance in the time course from onset of steering control to lane change, while high subjective difficulty of SuRT was related to increased steering angle variance in the time course after lane change. This suggests that both cognitive and visual loads affect driving performance after TOR in automated driving, but the effects appear in different time courses.","Automated driving, Visual load, Cognitive load, Driving performance, Take-over request",Damee Choi and Toshihisa Sato and Takafumi Ando and Takashi Abe and Motoyuki Akamatsu and Satoshi Kitazaki,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018303296,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103074,0003-6870,2020,103074,85,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of cognitive and visual loads on driving performance after take-over request (TOR) in automated driving,article,CHOI2020103074
"Background The fast-paced and rapidly changing environment of an Emergency Department (ED) requires providers to have a high level of situation awareness (SA). However, acute clinical care also encompasses a multitude of interruption-laden work processes that might degrade SA. It is therefore important to understand how frequent interruptions affect ED provider cognition in general and SA in particular. Objective We aimed to examine how sources and contents of provider workflow interruptions influence situation awareness of ED physicians and nurses. Methods This prospective, multi-method study combined standardized observations, self-reports of ED providers, and ED administrative data of staffing and patient load. Expert observers identified ED providersâ?? workflow interruptions during 90min observation sessions. Afterwards, each provider reported perceived disruptiveness and situation awareness. Controlling for patient load, patient acuity and staffing, we conducted regression analyses to explore prospective associations between interruptions and provider outcomes. Results During 74 observation sessions of overall 110h and 40min, we observed 1205 workflow interruptions (mean rate: 10.9 interruptions/hour). Provider situation awareness was fairly high (MÂ =Â 7.10; scale 0â??10) with no difference between ED physicians and nurses. After controlling for ED workload data, we observed that high rates of interruptions were associated with lower levels of situation awareness (Î²Â =Â â??0.27). Further analyses revealed that particularly interruptions by telephone/beeper, technical malfunctions as well as interruptive communication related to completed cases were correlated to low SA. Discussion This study in a naturalistic ED setting shows that ED physicians and nurses continuously cope with disruptions and interruptions. Our findings reveal that highly interruptive workflow environments impede providers' situation awareness. Moreover, it sheds light on specific sources and contents of interruptions that influence providersâ?? SA in acute care. Conclusion Frequent workflow interruptions can degrade ED providersâ?? situation awareness. A deeper understanding of how avoidable and unavoidable interruptions affect provider cognitions with particular focus on social and technology-related disruptions is required. Further emphasis should be placed on the effective application of work re-design in this context to foster safe and efficient patient care.","Emergency care, Nursing, Clinical care, Task interruptions, Cognitive performance, Situation awareness",Matthias Weigl and Ken Catchpole and Markus Wehler and Anna Schneider,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301101,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103155,0003-6870,2020,103155,88,Applied Ergonomics,Workflow disruptions and provider situation awareness in acute care: An observational study with emergency department physicians and nurses,article,WEIGL2020103155
"The current research proposed and tested a structural equation model (SEM) that describes hypothesized relationships among factors affecting trust in human-robot interaction (HRI) such as trustworthiness, human-likeness, intelligence, perfect automation schema (PAS), and affect. A video stimulus depicting an autonomous guard robot interacting with humans was employed as a stimulus via Amazon's Mechanical Turk to recruit 233 participants. Human-related and robot-related metrics were found to affect trustworthiness that subsequently affected trust. In particular, ability (as a trustworthiness facet) was a dominant factor affecting trust in HRI. Integrity was found to mediate the relationships between robot- and human-related metrics and trustworthiness. This study also showed a correlation between intelligence and trustworthiness, as well as between PAS and trustworthiness.

"This study aimed to examine prospective associations of mobile touch screen device (i.e. smartphone, tablet) use and patterns of use with musculoskeletal symptoms and visual health among adolescents. A representative sample of 1691 adolescents in Singapore (51% girls; 10â??19 years) completed an online questionnaire at baseline and one-year follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, prospective associations were found between baseline smartphone use and follow-up neck/shoulder (ORÂ =Â 1.61(95%CIÂ =Â 1.06â??2.44)) and low back (ORÂ =Â 1.86(1.10â??3.14)) symptoms; tablet use was also associated with neck/shoulder, low back and arms symptoms (ORÂ =Â 1.33(1.04â??1.71)to1.52(1.18â??1.95)). No associations were observed between the duration of smartphone/tablet use and symptoms. Baseline patterns of use (bout length, certain types of activities, multitasking) were associated with follow-up musculoskeletal symptoms. Smartphone/tablet use was not related to visual outcomes (visual symptoms, wearing glasses/contact lenses, myopia) at follow-up. These findings suggest that patterns of smartphone/tablet use (though not the duration of use) can pose a prospective risk for musculoskeletal symptoms.","Smartphone, Tablet, Pain",Siao Hui Toh and Pieter Coenen and Erin K.

"Stairs are associated with falls, especially when step dimensions are inconsistent. However, the mechanisms by which inconsistencies cause this higher risk are mostly theoretical. In this experimental study we quantified the effect of inconsistent rise heights on biomechanical measurements of stepping safety from younger (nÂ =Â 26) and older adults (nÂ =Â 33). In ascent, both groups decreased foot clearance (~9Â mm) over the inconsistently higher step (F(1,56)Â =Â 48.4, pÂ <Â 0.001). In descent, they reduced foot contact length on the higher step by 3% (F(1,56)Â =Â 9.1, pÂ <Â 0.01). Reduced clearance may result in a toe-catch potentially leading to a trip, while reduced foot contact lengths increase the risk of overstepping which may also lead to a fall. These effects occurred because participants did not alter their foot trajectories, indicating they either did not detect or were not able to adjust to the inconsistent rise, increasing the likelihood of a fall. Consistent stair construction is vital, and existing inconsistencies should be identified and safety interventions developed.","Variable dimensions, Step geometry, Fall risk",Natasha C.

"This study investigated the muscle strength and performance fatigability of the forearms in eight male orthopaedic surgeons when performing bone screw fixations. Each surgeon performed an eight-bone screws operations in a porcine femur model to simulate fractural fixation using plating technique. The pre- and post-fatigue maximum isometric forces and corresponding electromyography responses were measured to assess the forearm muscle strength loss and fatigue due to screwing. Results showed that after eight bone screws were inserted, the maximal grip force, maximal driving torque and maximal push force losses were approximately 29%, 20% and 23%, respectively. While the grip force and/or driving torque acting, both the brachioradialis and extensor carpi ulnaris had a higher percentage change of EMG than the biceps brachii. The driving forces decreased with the number of screw insertions; however, the insertion time increased parabolically with the number of screws and significantly decreased the insertion rate of the screws, indicating that forearm muscle fatigue may occur in surgeons who treat fracture fixation using more than eight bone screws.","Performance fatigability, Maximum isometric forces, driving torque, Handgrip",Chih-Kun Hsiao and Yuan-Kun Tu and Yi-Jung Tsai and Chun-Yuh Yang and Chih-Wei Lu,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300934,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103135,0003-6870,2020,103135,87,Applied Ergonomics,Forearm muscular strength and performance fatigability in orthopaedic surgeons when performing bone screw fixations,article,HSIAO2020103135

Currently, corporate sustainability is focused mainly on the triple bottom line (TBL) concept. In this context, the integration of ergonomics is fragmented and arguably separate from strategic human-resource functions (which have largely been the primary promoter of the internal-social component of corporate sustainability). This research argues that corporate sustainability requires a new step, improving the decision-making process, with the inclusion of more types of rationalities and the recognition of the centrality of workers in the process of creating sustainable action. When corporate sustainability policies focus on worker centrality, they open space for the integration of ergonomics as a pillar of an organization's corporate sustainability strategy. Based on a complex view of work systems, ergonomics can introduce values aligned with sustainability and promote cooperation in organizations. Different stakeholders working at companies can make use of different concepts proposed by ergonomics and other work sciences to support changes in their decision-making processes. In view of broader sustainability objectives, integrating different work-related considerations can help improve performance, including productivity, quality and health.","Ergonomics, Sustainable development, Corporate sustainability, Decision-making process, Rationalities, Sustainability based on values",I.

"Prolonged driving could induce neuromuscular fatigue and discomfort since drivers have little opportunity to adjust their position. However, better car seat design could play a major role in limiting these effects. This study compared the effect of two different seats (S - soft and F - firm) on neuromuscular fatigue and driver's perceived discomfort during prolonged driving, also assessing the effect of different road types on neuromuscular activity. Twenty participants performed two 3-h driving sessions, one for each seat, on a static simulator. Every 20Â min, participants self-evaluated their level of whole-body and individual body-area discomfort. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was recorded for eight muscles including Trapezius descendens (TD), Erector spinae longissimus (ESL), Multifidus (MF), Vastus lateralis (VL) and Tibialis anterior (TA) throughout the driving sessions. Moreover, an endurance static test (EST) was performed prior to and after each driving session. Whole-body discomfort increased with time with both seats, but no difference in discomfort scores was observed between seats throughout the driving sessions. The highest discomfort scores were for neck and lower back areas with both seats. Neuromuscular fatigue was revealed by a shorter endurance time in post-driving EST for both seats. EMG recordings showed different neuromuscular fatigue profiles for the two seats, with earlier onset of fatigue for S. Despite the lack of difference in perceived discomfort level, the two seats have different impacts: the softness of S induces greater activity of the lower back muscles, while F offers greater support for the lower back.","Seat design, Prolonged driving, Neuromuscular fatigue, Discomfort",Mathieu Lecocq and Pascaline Lantoine and ClÃ©ment Bougard and Jean-Marc AllÃ¨gre and Laurent Bauvineau and Christophe Bourdin and Tanguy Marqueste and Erick Dousset,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300776,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103118,0003-6870,2020,103118,87,Applied Ergonomics,Neuromuscular fatigue profiles depends on seat feature during long duration driving on a static simulator,article,LECOCQ2020103118
"This study aims to validate a conceptual model for shoulder pain risk factors in two independent samples of male industrial workers: the Cosali cohort (nÂ =Â 334) and one pharmaceutical company (nÂ =Â 487). Direct and indirect relationships between work organization factors (automatic speed of a machine or movement of a product and work pace dependent on customersâ?? demand), psychosocial factors (Job strain model), biomechanical factors (working with abducted arms, working with arms at or above shoulder level, and perceived physical exertion), perceived stress, and shoulder pain were explored using structural equation models. Shoulder pain was positively associated with biomechanical exposure in both samples, and with perceived stress only in the pharmaceutical preparation manufacturer, while factors related to work organization and psychosocial factors had indirect impacts on the risk of chronic shoulder pain in both samples. The results provide a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between workplace risk factors and shoulder pain.","Shoulder pain, Occupational exposure, Structural equation model",Julie Bodin and Ronan GarlantÃ©zec and Nathalie Costet and Alexis Descatha and Jean-FranÃ§ois Viel and Yves Roquelaure,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300259,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103075,0003-6870,2020,103075,85,Applied Ergonomics,Shoulder pain among male industrial workers: Validation of a conceptual model in two independent French working populations,article,BODIN2020103075
"Existing literature outlines mothers' negative experiences with breast pumps, yet a gap exists of which breast pump characteristics are important to mothers. Identifying which breast pump characteristics are important to breast pumping mothers, and any variation between mothers who do or do not work outside of the home, will help identify user needs. A survey collected information on mothers' experiences with breast pumps and impressions of their characteristics. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to determine whether there were possible groupings of impressions of these characteristics. The LCA identified a two-class model with mothers' age as a significant covariate. Portability, ease of use, low-weight, fast milk extraction, comfortability, low-noise, and discreet were all found to be important to one group of mothers, while only portability, ease of use, fast milk extraction, and comfortability were found to be important to another group of mothers. Mothers' work status was not a significant covariate but did predict class membership when considered as a grouping variable in conjunction with age. Breast pumping mothers' needs were found to differ based on their work status and age together, and collecting and considering these different needs is vital to creating redesigns that improve mothersâ?? breast pumping experience.","Breast pump experience, User-centered design, Latent class analysis",Rachel L.

"This study was to examine the kinematics, muscle activities, and perceived physical exertion in different regions of the spine during patient transfers by nursing students between a bed and a wheelchair, with or without a transfer belt in a laboratory setting. Results showed that with the effect of the belt, the % maximum voluntary contraction of the lumbar erector spinae was reduced significantly by nearly 10%. Muscle activity was significantly increased in thoracic erector and multifidus spinae during wheelchair-to-bed transfer, compared to bed-to-wheelchair transfers. There was no significant effect of belt or task on the spinal angular displacement in different spinal regions. Using the transfer belt was associated with a significantly decreased score for perceived exertion. In conclusion, this study supports the use of a transfer belt contributing to lower muscle activity and lower perceived physical exertion in the low back.","Low-tech patient transfer assistive devices, Electromyography, Kinematics",Kin Cheung and Jay Dai and Chun Lok Cheung and Hung Kai Cho and Yan Lam Chow and Ka Yin Fung and Wai Sze Lam and Hoi Leong {Calvin Li} and Sin {Ying Ng} and Man Ying Ngan and Grace Szeto,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301656,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102940,0003-6870,2020,102940,82,Applied Ergonomics,The biomechanical evaluation of patient transfer tasks by female nursing students: With and without a transfer belt,article,CHEUNG2020102940
"There are compelling findings that open-plan office environments are associated with declines in employee wellbeing. In spite of this, the move towards shared office environments continues; yet there is a lack of research describing open-plan offices that have positive outcomes for workers. We describe a â??best practiceâ? open-plan fit-out of a law firm and provide data from occupants relating to their performance, well-being, and collegial relationships. Six months after moving to an open-plan office, staff were anonymously surveyed, and 24 were interviewed. Fourteen months later, occupants responded to a follow-up survey. Positive outcomes relating to aesthetics, collegiality, and communication were achieved through good technical design and thoughtful ergonomic assessment of the needs of employees and the requirements of their tasks. A gender difference emerged whereby female, but not male, workers in this environment reported feeling observed. This has implications for the relatively different impact these environments may have on workers. Thus, by following ergonomic principles to create open-plan offices that are â??safe by designâ?? organizations can ameliorate many of the negative consequences associated with these environments.","Open-plan offices, Well-being, Gender, Productivity",Rachel L.

"For parents working in the transportation industry, atypical schedules are often a daily puzzle. Schedule planning systems allowing workers to choose shifts may affect job strenuousness and work-family balance (WFB) for both female and male workers. How could ergonomic interventions related to the implementation of those systems better consider gender dynamics regarding WFB strategies, and minimize inequities among workers? This article presents a joint analysis of two independent case studies related to ergonomic interventions in transport companies in Canada and Switzerland. Direct observation and semi-structured interviews shed light on the characteristics of schedule planning systems and their interaction with men's and women's WFB strategies. Issues related to each step of the planning process (shift construction, schedule choice, day-to-day schedule management) are discussed to inform interventions aimed at facilitating WFB, and ultimately gender equity, in atypical schedule contexts.","Atypical schedules, Ergonomic intervention, Work-family balance, Gender",MÃ©lanie LefranÃ§ois and Isabelle Probst,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019302108,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.103000,0003-6870,2020,103000,83,Applied Ergonomics,"â??They say we have a choice, but we don'tâ?: A gendered reflection on work-family strategies and planning systems of atypical schedules within male-dominated occupations in Canada and Switzerland",article,LEFRANCOIS2020103000
"Resilient systems strive to enhance the safety of complex systems through building and developing adaptive technological and organizational capacities. This study aims at analyzing and improving the level of adaptive capacity in a petrochemical plant by means of an integrated quantitative approach. The data were gathered by a questionnaire whose reliability is examined by statistical methods. To compute and analyze the influence of resilience engineering (RE) indicators, teamwork, and redundancy on adaptive capacity, data envelopment analysis (DEA) method was used. The results indicate that teamwork and redundancy have a positive effect on enhancing the level of adaptive capacity. Multilayer perceptron (MLP), a machine learning approach, was used to estimate the level of adaptive capacity on the basis of a dataset. The results of DEA and MLP approaches are confirmed by statistical methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that measures quantitatively and improves adaptive capacity by an integrated DEA-MLP approach based on the stress-strain model. The outcomes of this study could assist managers and other decision-makers of complex systems to compute and improve the level of adaptive capacity for coping with upcoming events in abnormal conditions.","Resilience engineering (RE), Adaptive capacity, Teamwork, Redundancy, Data envelopment analysis (DEA), Machine learning",V.

"The design process in preventive and prospective ergonomic contexts requires creativity. However, user-centered methods are not usually aimed at supporting creative design. We therefore devised two variants of the seminal brainstorming technique to favor ideation during design activities. One variant encouraged participants to focus on the evocation of ideas, like the seminal technique, whereas the other emphasized the evocation of constraints related to the design problem. To analyze the effects of these variants on creative design, we conducted three studies: one with future designers (Study 1), one with future generalist teachers (Study 2), and one with future teachers specializing in creative activities (Study 3). Depending on the study, participants were provided with idea evocation instructions, constraint evocation instructions, or no specific instructions. Results allowed us to identify the best conditions for promoting creativity in design, depending on the individual's specialty or the complexity of the design task.","Creativity, Design, Brainstorming",Nathalie Bonnardel and John Didier,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018305520,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102987,0003-6870,2020,102987,83,Applied Ergonomics,Brainstorming variants to favor creative design,article,BONNARDEL2020102987
"Interest in the field of emotions in the workplace continues to grow. However, a narrow range of measurements exists for the examination of affective states in organizational settings, all of which were developed based on the discrete-emotions approach. The main objective of the current study was to develop and validate a new instrument to assess four work-related (WR) affective feelings (WORAF): WR feelings of happiness, WR feelings of anxiety, WR feelings of anger, and WR feelings of dejection. Three independent samples of Polish employees in different occupations were included in the study (nâ?¯=â?¯297, nâ?¯=â?¯3019, nâ?¯=â?¯284).

"We hypothesized that an incorrect expectation due to spatial disorientation may induce roll reversal errors. To test this, an in-flight experiment was performed, in which forty non-pilots rolled wings level after receiving motion cues. A No-leans condition (subthreshold motion to a bank angle) was included, as well as a Leans-opposite condition (leans cues, opposite to the bank angle) and a Leans-level condition (leans cues, but level flight). The presence of leans cues led to an increase of the roll reversal error (RRE) rate by a factor of 2.6. There was no significant difference between the Leans-opposite and Leans-level condition. This suggests that the expectation strongly affects the occurrence of an RRE, and that people tend to base their responses on motion cues instead of on information on the AI. We conclude that expectation and spatial disorientation have a large effect on piloting errors and may cause hazardous aircraft upsets.","Aviation, Displays, Spatial disorientation, Surprise, Upset recovery",Annemarie Landman and Simon Davies and Eric L.

"Although the modelling of interactions has long been at the core of socio-technical systems theory, and is a key for understanding resilience, there is a lack of a holistic taxonomy of interactions. This study introduces a taxonomy of interactions to be used in association with the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). The taxonomy has nine criteria: nature of agents, output nature, levelling, waiting time, distance, degree of coupling, visibility, safety and/or security hazards, and parallel replications. For each criterion, two descriptors are proposed: what the interaction looks like; and - when applicable - the variability level of the interaction. The use of the taxonomy is presented for three systems with clearly distinct complexity characteristics: cash withdrawal from an ATM, teaching a university course, and manufacturing operations. These case studies indicate the usefulness of the taxonomy for the identification of leverage points in work system design. They also show the value of modelling the variability of the interactions in FRAM models, in addition to the traditional modelling of the variability of the outputs of functions. Implications of the taxonomy for resilience engineering are discussed.","Interactions, Socio-technical systems, Complex systems, FRAM, Human factors, Taxonomy",Tarcisio {Abreu Saurin} and Riccardo Patriarca,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301930,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102980,0003-6870,2020,102980,82,Applied Ergonomics,A taxonomy of interactions in socio-technical systems: A functional perspective,article,ABREUSAURIN2020102980

"This study explores how different aspects of working time demands (e.g., shift work) and working time control (e.g., beginning/end of workday) can be clustered into distinct types of work schedules and how they relate to health and work-life balance. Data from 13,540 full-time employees interviewed in the 2015 BAuA-Working Time Survey was used. By means of latent class analysis, we extracted six types of work schedules. Subjective health was highest in the flexible extended and flexible standard schedules, both featuring high working time control. Work-life balance was highest in the flexible standard and rigid standard schedules and lowest in schedules with high working time demands, namely the extended shift, rigid all-week, and rigid extended schedules. Employees with high working time demands and low control represent risk groups prone to impairments of well-being. Overall, this study offers an intuitive taxonomy for the design of sustainable work schedules.","Working hours, Flexibility, Well-being",Corinna Brauner and Anne M.

"Objective Prolonged sitting, which is highly prevalent in office workers, has been associated with several health risks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the Dynamic Work intervention by determining its effect on total sitting time at the 8-month follow-up in comparison to the control. Methods This two-arm pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial included 244 office workers from 14 different departments of a large, Dutch insurance company. The Dynamic Work intervention was a real-life, worksite intervention that included environmental components (i.e. sit-stand workstations), organisational components (i.e. group sessions), and individual components (e.g. activity/sitting trackers). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 4-month follow-up, and 8-month follow-up. The primary outcome was total sitting time per day, objectively assessed using the activPAL activity monitor at 8-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included other total and occupational movement behaviour outcomes, health-related outcomes, and work-related outcomes. Data analyses were performed using linear and logistic mixed models. Results Total sitting time did not differ between the intervention and control group at the 8-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes also showed no difference between the intervention and control group at either the 4-month or at 8-month follow-up, with the exception of number of occupational steps, which showed a statistically significant effect at 4-month follow-up (but not at 8-month follow-up) of 913 (95% CIÂ =Â 381â??1445) steps/8-h working day. Conclusions This study evaluated the effectiveness of a real-life worksite intervention to reduce sitting time and showed little to no effect. This may be due to the relatively low intensity of the intervention, i.e. that it only involved the replacement of 25% of sitting workstations with sit-stand workstations. Future research should focus on the evaluation of more intensive real-life worksite interventions that are still feasible for implementation in daily practice.

"Human movement control requires attention to accurately tune motor commands in response to environmental changes. Dual task paradigms are used to test the role of attention on motor performance. Usually the tasks used have little resemblance with every day experience. Here we ask: Does a common cognitive task, such as a mobile phone conversation, compromise motor performance on stairs? Eight young participants negotiated an instrumented seven-step staircase. Stair negotiation while talking on a mobile phone was compared to normal stair negotiation. Stepping parameters, jerk cost (measure of smoothness of locomotion) and step clearance were measured. When talking on a mobile phone, participantsâ?? overall body velocity (mean(sd): Ascent 0.534(0.026) vs 0.511(0.024) m/s, Descent 0.642(0.026) vs 0.511(0.024) m/s, No phone/Phone respectively) and cadence decreased significantly (Ascent 75.8(5.8) vs 65.6(4.4) steps/min, Descent 117.4(4.2) vs 108.6(6.0) steps/min, No Phone/Phone respectively). Pelvis and feet jerk cost also changed significantly, mostly decreasing with phone use. Foot clearance did not show significant changes between No Phone and Phone conditions. These pilot results show that, even for young, healthy and cognitively intact individuals, talking on a mobile phone whilst negotiating a staircase induces measurable changes in motor performance. Participants moved slowly but more smoothly, reducing the motor control cost, possibly at the expense of movement accuracy. The reduction in motor performance is likely to be due to the difficulty in integrating the two sub-tasks. These results suggest that even young, healthy individuals show stair gait impairment when simultaneously negotiating stairs and performing another cognitive task, such as talking on the phone.","Dual task, Locomotor performance, Control cost, Information processing interference",Irene {Di Giulio} and Bradford J.

"Communication in teams plays a vital role in team success. This work proposes Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) as a formalized, team communication methodology for the analysis of content and flow, simultaneously, of naturalistic team communication in a structured environment. Several methods of analysis of team communication exist. Few of them, however, analyze the flow and content of communication simultaneously, and none with teams using naturalistic language. Team communication data is coded for flow and content (through speech acts), then turned into FCMs for visual and statistical analysis. Results show that when using the FCM methodology both flow and content of communication can be diagrammed at the individual level, however, when assessing at the team level, what is illustrated is the flow of content. The application of different statistical analyses to the FCM output provides the opportunity to answer various questions on team communication. This study demonstrates that by using speech acts (SAs) as nodes, FCMs can illustrate and analyze team communication flow and content for naturalistic language. The FCM methodology is a powerful tool for studying team communication, and further incremental work could advance knowledge in team communication dynamics and provide contributions to graph theory. This method provides a visual overview of team communication dynamics in a naturalistic language setting, thus allowing for the study of intra-team dynamics and inter-team dynamics simultaneously.","Communication analysis, Team mental models, Naturalistic language analysis",Dominique {Engome Tchupo} and Jung Hyup Kim and Gretchen A.

Upon waking, sleep inertia was quantified using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and Psychomotor Vigilance and Spatial Configuration Tasks, administered at 15-min intervals. Compared to control, participants felt sleepier post waking when on-call and sleepiest in the low stress compared to the high stress condition (pâ?¯<â?¯.001). Spatial performance was faster when on-call compared to control (pâ?¯<â?¯.001). Findings suggest that anticipating a high-stress task when on-call, does not impact sleep inertia severity.","Stress, Cognitive performance, Stand-by work",Katya Kovac and Grace E.

"Traction testing of footwear is expensive, which may create barriers for certain users to assess footwear. This study aimed to develop a statistical model that predicts available coefficient of friction (ACOF) under boundary lubrication conditions based on inexpensive measurements of footwear outsole features. Geometric and material hardness parameters were measured from fifty-eight footwear designs labeled as slip-resistant. A robotic friction measurement device was used to quantify ACOF with canola oil as the contaminant. Stepwise regression methods were used to develop models based on the outsole parameters and floor type to predict ACOF. The predictive ability of the regression models was tested using the k-fold cross-validation method. Results indicated that 87% of ACOF variation was explained by three shoe outsole parameters (tread surface area, heel shape, hardness) and floor type. This approach may provide an assessment tool for safety practitioners to assess footwear traction and improve workersâ?? safety.","Slips, Coefficient of friction, Shoe safety, Shoe traction assessment, Slip-resistant",Arian Iraqi and Natasa S.

"Within the Police service of England and Wales the wearing of ballistic and stab resistant body armour is common, with most police forces mandating its usage when away from the police station. Of all the serving police officers in England and Wales 29.1% are female (Hargreaves et al., 2017). A survey was developed and then distributed by the Police Federation of England and Wales to all servicing police officers up to the rank of Inspector. The survey returned 2633 responses after cleaning of the data. From the responses it was seen that the predominant bra type worn is underwired (71%) and the predominant UK bra size is 34B (9%). It was also determined that the predominant areas where the body armour either rubbed or caused discomfort were the left and right anterior mammary regions and the posterior lateral sacral region. By understanding the distribution of bra size, type of bra worn and areas of discomfort or rubbing it helps further understand the issues faced by female police officers and how body armour design could be improved.","UK bra size, Sports bra, Underwired bra, Activity",Chris Malbon and Dr Clare Knock and Dr Richard Critchley and Prof {Debra J Carr},https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019302212,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.103012,0003-6870,2020,103012,84,Applied Ergonomics,The effect of breast size and bra type on comfort for UK female police officers wearing body armour,article,MALBON2020103012
"This study investigated the biomechanical loads and kinematics of workers during multiple-task manual material handling (MMH) jobs, and developed prediction models for the moments acting on a worker's body and their peak joint angles. An experiment was conducted in which 20 subjects performed a total of 3780 repetitions of a box-conveying task. This task included continuous sequential removing, carrying and depositing of boxes weighing 2â??12â?¯kg. The subjects' motion was captured using motion-capture technology. The origin/destination height was the most influencing predictor of the spinal and shoulder moments and the peak trunk, shoulder and knee angles. The relationship between the origin/destination heights and the above parameters was nonlinear. The mass of the box, and the subject's height and mass, also influenced the spinal and shoulder moments. A tradeoff between the moments acting on the L5/S1 vertebrae and on the shoulder joint was found. Compared to the models developed in similar studies that focused on manual material handling (albeit under different conditions), the high-order prediction equation for peak spinal moment formulated in the present study was found to explain between 10% and 48% more variability in the moments. This suggests that using a high-order equation in future studies might improve the prediction.","Manual material handling, Spinal moments, Shoulder moments, Joint angle",Yaar Harari and Avital Bechar and Raziel Riemer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018303910,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102985,0003-6870,2020,102985,83,Applied Ergonomics,Workersâ?? biomechanical loads and kinematics during multiple-task manual material handling,article,HARARI2020102985
"Many physiological factors, such as spinal elongation, bone atrophy, and muscle loss, occur when humans are exposed to a microgravity environment. These physiological changes can result in slight to drastic changes in body dimensions. Any drastic change in body dimensions is critical information for current and future space hardware designers. These changes can affect accommodation, safety, and performance of a crewmember while in space. This study measured the overall change in seated height and stature for crewmembers exposed to a microgravity environment. Seated height data were obtained from 29 crewmembers that included 8 International Space Station increment crew (2 females and 6 males) and 21 Shuttle crew (1 female and 20 males). The results indicate that all participating crewmembers experienced statistically significant change in seated height. The corresponding change, 6% from preflight, should be considered for vehicle designs as the necessary seated microgravity adjustment.","Anthropometry, Astronaut, Spinal elongation, NASA",Karen S.

"Objective Effective teamwork is critical to patient safety across multiple healthcare settings. However, current observational tools assessing teamwork performance tend to be developed for specific settings or tasks and do not capture temporal features of interaction. This study aimed to develop a valid and reliable observational teamwork behaviour framework, which is based on healthcare practice, applicable across a variety of healthcare contexts and can be used to capture temporal team dynamics. Methods Team interactions were audio-visually recorded during routine simulation training at two large clinical education centres specialising in physical and mental healthcare. The framework was based on theoretical models of teamwork and was developed in three steps: 1-micro analysis of verbal and nonverbal behaviour during recorded scenarios (nâ?¯=â?¯20); 2-iterative test and refine cycles; 3-final behavioural framework applied to a cohort of acute emergency scenarios (nâ?¯=â?¯9) by two raters to assess inter-rater agreement. Results The framework contains twenty-three specific verbal and nonverbal behaviours that can be identified during observations. Behaviours are grouped conceptually based on their function resulting in thirteen behavioural functions, which cluster into five overarching teamwork domains. Inter-rater agreement was excellent (Cohen's Kappaâ?¯=â?¯.84, SEâ?¯=â?¯0.03). Conclusion We present a valid and reliable behavioural framework, grounded in teamwork theory and empirical observations of clinical team behaviour. This framework enables analysis of the nuances and temporal features of clinical practice in depth and across a wide range of clinical contexts and settings. Use of this framework will advance our understanding of teamworking in healthcare.","Teamwork, Communication, Observational analysis, Human factors, Patient safety",Mary Lavelle and Gabriel B.

"Repetitive and intensive exercises during robot-aided rehabilitation may expose patients to inappropriate and unsafe postures. The introduction of a sensory feedback can help the subject to perform the rehabilitation task with an ergonomic posture. In this work, the introduction of visual and vibrotactile feedback in a robotic platform for upper limb rehabilitation has been proposed to ensure ergonomic posture during rehabilitation. The two feedback modalities have been used to provide information about incorrect neck and trunk posture. Ten healthy subjects have been involved in this study. Each of them performed 3D reaching movements with the aid of the robotic platform in three different conditions, i.e. without feedback, with visual feedback and with vibrotactile feedback, and a comparative analysis has been carried out to evaluate feedback effectiveness, acceptance and performance. Experimental results show that in case of no feedback the subjects reach and maintain configurations that can lead to incorrect neck and trunk configurations and therefore, if repeated, to musculoskeletal disorders. Conversely, with visual or vibrotactile feedback, the subjects tend to correct inappropriate posture with both trunk and head during task performing.","Upper-Limb Robot-Aided Rehabilitation, Assistance-as-needed, Sensory feedback, Ergonomic posture",Francesco {Scotto di Luzio} and Clemente Lauretti and Francesca Cordella and Francesco Draicchio and Loredana Zollo,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018307671,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102950,0003-6870,2020,102950,82,Applied Ergonomics,Visual vs vibrotactile feedback for posture assessment during upper-limb robot-aided rehabilitation,article,SCOTTODILUZIO2020102950
"Although complexity and resilience are key inter-related characteristics of construction projects, little is known on how to monitor these characteristics and their implications for safety management. This study investigates the contribution of Safety Performance Measurement Systems (SPMS) as a means for monitoring and understanding of sources of complexity and resilience in construction. It is based in three empirical studies carried out in construction projects, two in Chile and one in Brazil. Two main tools were applied in these studies: (i) the Technical, Organizational and Environmental (TOE) framework, focused on complexity; and (ii) the Resilience Assessment Grid (RAG), focused on resilience. Improvement opportunities were identified for existing SPMS. Also, a set of guidelines for the design of SPMS emerged from these studies as well as a model that explains the connections between the main constructs encompassed by the guidelines.","Resilience engineering, Project complexity, Safety performance measurement systems",Guillermina Andrea PeÃ±aloza and Tarcisio Abreu Saurin and Carlos Torres Formoso,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301917,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102978,0003-6870,2020,102978,82,Applied Ergonomics,Monitoring complexity and resilience in construction projects: The contribution of safety performance measurement systems,article,PENALOZA2020102978
"Cybersickness, i.e. visually induced motion sickness, remains as a negative effect that is detrimental to the user experience of VEs (virtual environments) developed for VR (virtual reality) consumers. As the VR technology evolves, it is rather triggered by application aspects rather than hardware limitations. For this reason, there is still a need for a measurement method to assess and compare VEs for cybersickness effects. SSQ (Simulation Sickness Questionnaire) is used for measuring usersâ?? level of sickness symptoms and is highly appreciated in VR research. However, it is criticized for its psychometric qualities and applicability in VR, as a measure of cybersickness. Recently, two variants of SSQ were offered for measuring cybersickness, CSQ (Cybersickness Questionnaire) and VRSQ (Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire). There is also another variant with a different factor structure, which we call FSSQ, that is based on French translation of SSQ. Our study compares SSQ and these variants for their psychometric qualities; construct validity, discriminant validity, internal reliability, test-retest reliability and sensitivity to distinguish application aspects of VEs that are related to cybersickness. Using a within-subjects experiment design, we evaluated 7 different VEs with 32 participants through 9 sessions, resulting with 288 responses to the 16-item SSQ. Results suggested that both VRSQ and CSQ were valid and reliable measures of cybersickness, as well as being sensitive to application aspects such as translational and rotational movements required by users for navigation in VEs. Compared to SSQ and FSSQ; the cybersickness questionnaires, CSQ and VRSQ, revealed better indicators of validity. On the other hand, we assume that the development of the two cybersickness scales had limitations in sample size to represent VR consumers and limitations in stimuli to represent the applications aspects of consumer VEs. We suggest further evaluation of cybersickness symptoms with larger samples and broader range of applications to identify the symptoms and the construct of a subjective measurement tool.","Cybersickness, Virtual reality, Visually induced motion sickness, Simulator sickness questionnaire, Scale, Psychometric evaluation",Volkan Sevinc and Mehmet Ilker Berkman,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301759,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102958,0003-6870,2020,102958,82,Applied Ergonomics,Psychometric evaluation of Simulator Sickness Questionnaire and its variants as a measure of cybersickness in consumer virtual environments,article,SEVINC2020102958
"The structural features of work boots worn by underground coal miners affect comfort, foot motion and, in turn, loading of the plantar surface of minersâ?? feet. Although shaft stiffness and sole flexibility appear to be boot design features that could influence perceived comfort and plantar pressures, no study has systematically altered these boot design features to truly understand how they affect these parameters. This study aimed to systematically investigate the effect of changes to shaft stiffness and sole flexibility on perceived comfort and plantar pressures when 20 males walked on a simulated gravel coal mining surface under four different work boot conditions. There were no significant effects of shaft stiffness or sole flexibility on perceived comfort. However, shaft stiffness and sole flexibility each significantly affected the plantar pressures generated under the medial midfoot, heel, middle metatarsals and hallux and, in combination, affected plantar pressures generated beneath the lateral midfoot, medial and lateral metatarsals and lesser toes. Participants preferred a boot with a flexible shaft combined with a stiff sole, citing properties such as fit, moveability, walking effort and support to explain why they perceived one boot as more comfortable than another. We therefore recommend that underground coal mining work boots should be designed to incorporate different flexibility and stiffness between the shaft and sole of the boot to optimise foot movement and, in turn, walking efficiency.",,Jessica A.

As an example of the model's application, we describe its use to improve patient identification for the University of Wisconsin health system's case management program. Our case study shows the importance of culture, infrastructure, and strong leadership support in realizing a learning health systems research project and creating sustainable change within the health system.

"Comfortable light emitting diode (LED) lighting conditions were examined for psychological and physiological responses. Eight male and eight female subjects participated in a series of experiments. They were exposed to light emitted from LED lights of 3000â?¯K in the ranges of 150â??400 lux and 1500â??5000 lux; 4000â?¯K in the ranges of 140â??640 lux and 2000â??5000 lux; and 5000â?¯K in the ranges of 70â??270 lux and 2500â??7000 lux. Illuminance at a given correlated color temperature was first maintained at the lowest value in the designated range and then increased in a stepwise manner. On reaching the highest value in the range, it was then decreased to the lowest value in a stepwise manner. The subjects were required to indicate their perception of brightness, glare, and comfort at the controlled illuminance levels. Electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram data were monitored continuously throughout exposure. The results showed that the boundary illuminances estimated from psychological and physiological responses did not significantly differ between male and female subjects, but differed markedly from those of fluorescent lights tested in a previous study. The high boundaries of the LED lights were higher than those of the fluorescent lights. The low boundaries of the LED lights at 3000â?¯K and 4000â?¯K were higher than those of the fluorescent lights, but the boundaries at 5000â?¯K were lower than those of the fluorescent lights. These differences may be due to differences in the spectral distribution and luminance for a given illuminance between LED and fluorescent lights.","Light intensity, Correlated color temperature, Heart rate variability, Electroencephalogram",Naoshi Kakitsuba,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018304058,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102941,0003-6870,2020,102941,82,Applied Ergonomics,Comfortable indoor lighting conditions for LEDlights evaluated from psychological and physiological responses,article,KAKITSUBA2020102941
"Objective To ascertain the reliability of a standardised, short-scale measure of satisfaction in the use of new healthcare technology i.e., the LITE version of the usability metric for user experience (UMUX-LITE). Whilst previous studies have demonstrated the reliability of UMUX-LITE, and its relationship with measures of likelihood to recommend a product, such as the Net Promoter Score (NPS) in other sectors no such testing has been undertaken with healthcare technology. Materials and methods Six point-of-care products at different stages of development were assessed by 120 healthcare professionals. UMUX-LITE was used to gather their satisfaction in use, and NPS to declare their intention to promote the product. Inferential statistics were used to: i) ascertain the reliability of UMUX-LITE, and ii) assess the relationship between UMUX-LITE and NPS at different stages of products development. Results UMUX-LITE showed an acceptable reliability (Î±Â =Â 0.7) and a strong positive correlation with NPS (rÂ =Â 0.455, pÂ <Â .001). This is similar to findings in other fields of application. The level of product development did not affect the UMUX-LITE scores, while the stage of development was a significant predictor (R2Â =Â 0.49) of the intention to promote. Discussion and conclusion Practitioners may apply UMUX-LITE alone, or in combination with the NPS, to complement interview and â??homemadeâ?? scales to investigate the quality of new products at different stages of development. This shortened scale is appropriate for use in the context of healthcare in which busy professionals have a minimal amount of time to support innovation.","Usability, Satisfaction, Point-of-care systems, In-vitro diagnostics, UMUX, UMUX-LITE, Net promoter score, Technology readiness level",Simone Borsci and Peter Buckle and Simon Walne,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019302169,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.103007,0003-6870,2020,103007,84,Applied Ergonomics,Is the LITE version of the usability metric for user experience (UMUX-LITE) a reliable tool to support rapid assessment of new healthcare technology?,article,BORSCI2020103007

"To date, vehicle manufacturers have largely been left to their own initiatives when it comes to the design, development and implementation of automated driving features. Whilst this has enabled developments within the field to accelerate at a rapid pace, we are also now beginning to see the negative aspects of automated design (e.g., driver complacency, automation misuse and ethical dilemmas). It is therefore becoming increasingly important to identify systemic aspects that can address some of these Human Factors challenges. This paper applies the principles of the Risk Management Framework to explore the wider systemic issues associated with automated driving in the United Kingdom through the novel application of network metrics. The authors propose a number of recommendations targeted at each level of the Risk Management Framework that seek to shift the power of influence away from vehicle manufacturers and back into the hands of governing bodies.","Driving automation, Network analysis, Risk management framework, Social network analysis",Victoria A.

"In this paper we study the working conditions of Community Health Workers in performing house calls within low-income, violent communities in order to understand the challenges in delivering primary care in developing countries. We conducted field studies in two primary healthcare clinics and telephone surveys for 5 months in 2017 within systematic sample of 1690 community health workers based on clinics distributed along the health regions of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A number of 759 interviews were completed, approximately 50% of the sample, 86% men and 14% women. Most participants are 30â??39 years old (35%), followed by 27% of 40â??49 years old participants. Results show that exposure to territorial violence and environmental or health-related diseases significantly affects CHWs. Moreover, CHWs have to develop a significant set of skills to cope with aspects of the territory, and those skills are not present in their training. As community health workers work on the sharp end of the healthcare system, responsible for outreaching, community education, counseling, and social support, our study presents contributions to government and management levels on working conditions inside communities, constraints in assistance, and difficulties in implementing primary care policies.","Community health workers, Family health, Primary health care",Alessandro JatobÃ¡ and Hugo Cesar Bellas and BÃ¡rbara BulhÃµes and Isabella Koster and Rodrigo Arcuri and Paulo Victor R. {de Carvalho},https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701830351X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102944,0003-6870,2020,102944,82,Applied Ergonomics,Assessing community health workersâ?? conditions for delivering care to patients in low-income communities,article,JATOBA2020102944
"The Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) and SEIPS 2.0 models provide a framework for integrating Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) in health care quality and patient safety improvement. As care becomes increasingly distributed over space and time, the â??processâ? component of the SEIPS model needs to evolve and represent this additional complexity. In this paper, we review different ways that the process component of the SEIPS models have been described and applied. We then propose the SEIPS 3.0 model, which expands the process component, using the concept of the patient journey to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of patientsâ?? interactions with multiple care settings over time. This new SEIPS 3.0 sociotechnical systems approach to the patient journey and patient safety poses several conceptual and methodological challenges to HFE researchers and professionals, including the need to consider multiple perspectives, issues with genuine participation, and HFE work at the boundaries.","SEIPS, Patient journey, Care coordination, Human-centered design, Participatory ergonomics, Patient safety",Pascale Carayon and Abigail Wooldridge and Peter Hoonakker and Ann Schoofs Hundt and Michelle M.

"This paper extends an earlier examination of the concept of â??mesoergonomicsâ?? (Karsh et al., 2014) and its application to Human Factors/Ergonomics (HFE). Karsh et al. (2014) developed a framework for mesoergonomic inquiry based on a set of steps and questions, the purpose of which was to encourage researchers to cross system levels in the studies (e.g., organisation-group-individual levels of analysis) and to explore alternative causal mechanisms and relationships within their data. The present paper further develops the framework and draws on previous work across a diverse range of sources (safety science, systems theory, the sociology of disaster and ethology) which has examined the subject of accident causation, levels of analysis and explanatory factors contributing to system failure. The outcomes from this exercise are a revised framework which seeks to explore what we term â??isomorphismsâ?? and includes questions covering: (a) how internal isomorphisms develop or evolve within the system; and, (b) how these isomorphisms are shaped by cultural, professional and other forms of external influence. The workings of the revised framework are illustrated through using the example of the UK NHS Morecambe Bay Investigation (Kirkup, 2015).

A sample of 500 coronial findings related to patient deaths following complications of surgical or medical care in Australia were reviewed using a modified-ICPS (mICPS). Over two-thirds (69.0%) of incidents occurred during treatment and 27.4% occurred in the operating theatre. Clinical process and procedures (55.9%), medication/IV fluids (11.2%) and healthcare-associated infection/complications (10.4%) were the most common incident types. Coroners made recommendations in 44.0% of deaths and organisations undertook preventive actions in 40.0% of deaths. This study demonstrated that the ICPS was able to be modified for practical use as a human factors taxonomy to identify sequences of incident types and contributing factors for patient deaths. Further testing of the mICPS is warranted.","Patient safety, Taxonomy, Error",Rebecca Mitchell and Mona Faris and Reidar Lystad and Diana {Fajardo Pulido} and Grace Norton and Melissa Baysari and Robyn Clay-Williams and Peter Hibbert and Andrew Carson-Stevens and Cliff Hughes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301474,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102920,0003-6870,2020,102920,82,Applied Ergonomics,Using the WHO International Classification of patient safety framework to identify incident characteristics and contributing factors for medical or surgical complication deaths,article,MITCHELL2020102920
"The interpretation of the calculated result of the revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE) has been problematic because the relationship of the calculated result to back injury risk has not always been either well understood nor consistently interpreted. During the revision of the ISO standard 11228â??1 (Manual lifting, lowering and carrying), an extensive literature review was conducted on validation studies of the RNLE. A systematic review of exposure-risk associations between the LI metrics and various low-back health outcomes from peer-reviewed epidemiological studies was conducted. Risk interpretations for different levels of calculated result of the RNLE are added to the ISO standard. Rationale for the risk interpretations is presented in this paper.","Revised NIOSH lifting equation, Manual lifting tasks, ISO standard",Robert R.

"This study investigates how the positions of paramedic equipment bags affect paramedic performance and biomechanical loads during out-of-hospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). An experiment was conducted in which 12 paramedic teams (each including two paramedics) performed in-situ simulations of a cardiac-arrest scenario. CPR quality was evaluated using five standard resuscitation measures (i.e., pre- and post-shock pauses, and compression rate, depth and fraction). The spinal loads while lifting, pulling and pushing the equipment bags were assessed using digital human modeling software (Jack) and prediction equation from previous studies. The results highlight where paramedics are currently choosing to position their equipment. They also demonstrate that the positions of the equipment bags affect CPR quality as well as the paramedics' work efficiency, physiological effort and biomechanical loads. The spinal loads ranged from 1901 to 4030N; furthermore, every occasion on which an equipment bag was lifted resulted in spinal forces higher than 3400N, thus exceeding the maximum threshold stipulated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. 72% of paramedics' postures were categorized as high or very high risk for musculoskeletal disorders by the Rapid Entire Body Assessment. Guidelines related to bag positioning and equipment handling might improve CPR quality and patient outcomes, and reduce paramedicsâ?? risk of injury.","Manual material handling, Paramedics, Ergonomics, CPR quality",Yaar Harari and Raziel Riemer and Eli Jaffe and Oren Wacht and Yuval Bitan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301905,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102977,0003-6870,2020,102977,82,Applied Ergonomics,Paramedic equipment bags: How their position during out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) affect paramedic ergonomics and performance,article,HARARI2020102977
"There are about 44 million licensed older drivers in the U.S. Older adults have higher crash rates and fatalities as compared to middle-aged and young drivers, which might be associated with degradations in sensory, cognitive, and physical capabilities. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) have the potential to substantially improve safety by removing some of driver vehicle control responsibilities. However, a critical aspect of providing ADAS is educating drivers on their operational characteristics and continued use. Twenty older adults participated in a driving simulation study assessing the effectiveness of video-based and demonstration-based training protocols in learning ADAS considering gender differences. The findings revealed video-based training to be more effective than demonstration-based training in improving driver performance and reducing off-road visual attention allocation and mental workload. In addition, female drivers required lower investment of mental effort (higher neural efficiency) to maintain the performance relative to males and they were less distracted by ADAS. However, male drivers were faster in activating ADAS as compared to females since they were monitoring the status of ADAS features more frequently while driving. The findings of this study provided an empirical support for using video-based approach for learning ADAS in older adults to improve driver safety and supported previous findings on older adultsâ?? learning that as age increases there is a tendency to prefer more passive and observational learning methods.","ADAS, Older adults, fNIRS",Maryam Zahabi and Ashiq Mohammed {Abdul Razak} and Ashley E.

"Everyday driving is a significant source of greenhouse gases and pollutants within developed nations. Finding ways to combat these emissions and minimise the impact of anthropometric climate change is a growing challenge for all research disciplines. This current paper explores the use of a design toolkit â??Design with Intentâ? to generate ideas for in-vehicle interfaces designed to reduce fuel use and emissions. A preliminary interface validation assessment is also presented in order to assess whether the ideas generated were appropriate in encouraging behavioural change and of potential value.

"Standing computer work is increasingly popular. However, despite the higher rates of computer work-related disorders in women, no studies have compared how standing work affects men and women. Twelve males and 12 females completed 90-min typing tasks in each posture while electromyography (EMG) data was recorded from eight muscles of the upper body. Results show that females had significantly higher EMG root-mean-squared (RMS) values in the anterior deltoid than males when seated, but higher EMG RMS in the medial trapezius than males when standing (SBCâ?¯â?¤â?¯0.05). In standing, they also had lower values than males in the erector spinae. Overall, standing elicited less activity in the upper trapezius, wrist extensors and erector spinae than sitting. Results suggest that the standing posture is generally less muscularly demanding than the seated one, although men and women's neck/shoulder musculature responds differently to the same task performed while seated or standing.","Computer work, Posture, Sex, Electromyography",Alexander Cui and Kim Emery and Anne-Sophie Beaudoin and Jessica Feng and Julie N.

"Patient ergonomics is the application of human factors or related disciplines to study and improve patients' and other non-professionalsâ?? performance of effortful work activities in pursuit of health goals. We performed a mapping review of 212 full-text patient ergonomics publications in two conference proceedings, 2007â??2017. The review revealed a robust and growing body of literature on patient ergonomics, particularly in the areas of aging and chronic disease, tools and technologies, and evaluations of patient-centered interventions on outcomes such as usability, user acceptance, and performance. Findings highlighted gaps deserving future research, including research with understudied populations such as children, informal caregivers, networks and collectives (groups), and marginalized populations; on topics such as health promotion and transitions of care; and using longitudinal and experimental study designs. The growth of patient-centeredness in general and of patient ergonomics in particular compel other more focused reviews, new primary research, and developing a roadmap for future patient ergonomics research.","Patient work, Patient engagement, Patient activation, Medical human factors, Patient-centered human factors and ergonomics",Richard J.

"Design features of safety work boots have the potential to influence how underground coal miners' feet interact with the challenging surfaces they walk on and, in turn, their risk of slipping. Despite the importance of work boot design in reducing the risk of miners slipping, limited research has investigated how boot design features, such as shaft stiffness and sole flexibility, affect the way miners walk. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of systematic variations to boot shaft stiffness and sole flexibility on lower limb muscle activity and ankle motion in preparation for initial foot-ground contact when 20 males walked across two simulated coal mining surfaces under four mining boot conditions. It was concluded that a boot which has different flexibility and stiffness between the shaft and sole is a better design option to reduce underground coal minersâ?? slip risk than a boot that has a stiff shaft and stiff sole or flexible shaft and flexible sole.","Boot design, Walking, Slip risk, Gait, Coal mining",Jessica A.

"Cyber threats are targeting vulnerabilities of human workers performing tasks in manufacturing processes, including visual inspection to bias their decision-making, thereby sabotaging product quality. This article examines the use of priming as a form of â??cognitive hackingâ? to adversely affect quality inspection decisions in manufacturing, and investigates physiological measurements as means to detect such intrusion. In a within-subject design experiment, twenty participants inspected surface roughness of a manufactured component with and without exposure to priming on the display of an inspection logging system. The results show that the presence of primes impacted accuracy on surface roughness, cortical activities at parietal lobe P4, and eye gaze for inspecting components. The experiment provides supporting evidence that basic hacking of a worker display can be an effective method to alter decision making in inspection. The findings also illustrate that cortical activities and eye gaze can be useful indicators of cognitive hacking. A major implication of the study results is that physiological indicators can be effective at revealing unconscious cognitive influence in visual inspection.","Additive manufacturing, Cognitive hacking, Cybersecurity, EEG, Eye-tracking, Inspection",Wenyan Huang and Xiaoyu Chen and Ran Jin and Nathan Lau,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019302315,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.103022,0003-6870,2020,103022,84,Applied Ergonomics,Detecting cognitive hacking in visual inspection with physiological measurements,article,HUANG2020103022

We compared the total scores of the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) across four different stimulation conditions (GCS, AS, Mixed GCS-AS and no stimulation as a baseline condition).

"Semi-autonomous cars are already on the road and highly autonomous cars will soon be with us. Little is understood about how drivers will adapt to the changing relationship with their vehicle, but to ensure safety and consumer acceptance, this insight is vital. To this end, an on-road study in a semi-autonomous vehicle was undertaken with six UK drivers. The â??think aloudâ?? technique was employed and video and audio footage of their interaction with the vehicle was captured. Neisser's (1976) Perceptual Cycle Model (PCM) was used to analyse the data and three case studies are presented to highlight how poor synergy between driver and semi-autonomous vehicles can occur from the lens of Schema, Action or World information. Seven key design considerations are proposed to ensure a more positive and safer interaction between driver and autonomous vehicle to guide focus by manufacturers. Further evidence for the existence of a â??counter cycleâ?? (Plant and Stanton, 2015) within the PCM is found and how this relates to the challenges of using verbal protocals expressed during a fast moving dynamic task is discussed.","Perceptual cycle model, Semi-autonomous vehicles, Interaction design, Usability",Kirsten M.A. Revell and Joy Richardson and Pat Langdon and Mike Bradley and Ioannis Politis and Simon Thompson and Lee Skrypchuck and Jim O'Donoghue and Alex Mouzakitis and Neville A.

"Musculoskeletal sitting discomfort, specifically caused by long-term sitting, is primarily triggered by physiological fatigue on the human body due to its own weight. Passive seat designs can produce inadequate surface pressure zones on the body resulting in high musculoskeletal stress leading to physical discomfort. However, as proposed in this work, this can be alleviated by decentralizing the occupant's weight with an automatic morphing lumbar seat design. The morphing seat design presented in this paper adjusts in real-time, the seat's surface curvature to decentralize the pressure distribution. The seat system consists of a custom-made pressure sensor mat embedded within the backrest cushion and two pneumatic actuators located in the lumbar area. The purpose of this seat design is to produce a change in the backrest surface curvature so that such change creates a pressure distribution closely resembling a reference distribution. Said reference distribution is derived in this work based on the concept of the Ideal Pressure Distribution. The effectiveness of the discomfort reduction due to the decentralization of the backrest load is evaluated using an objective discomfort metric known as Seat Pan Distribution percentage applied only to the backrest, peak pressure areas and contact area. Preliminary performance tests of the seat system demonstrate the successful decentralization of the passenger's pressure distribution. The evaluation of the discomfort reduction is observed via the lowering in the objective discomfort metric and peak pressure areas while simultaneously increasing the contact area between the passenger and seat.","Seat design, Pressure sensing, Morphing seat, Ideal pressure distribution, Backrest, Aircraft seat, Lumbar control",Gabriel H.

"Driversâ?? non-compliance with rules is a prominent factor in collisions with trains at railway level crossings. Road user impatience and frustration has been identified as an underlying factor in non-compliance and can be characterised as a specific risk factor. However, research on non-compliance related to waiting times and driver inconvenience lacks in the literature. This paper, therefore, seeks to enhance the currently limited understanding of the relationship between waiting times and risky driver behaviour. An Advanced Driving Simulator was used to obtain objective measures of level crossing non-compliance. Subjective measures on driver frustration and decision-making processes were also collected. Sixty participants completed six driving tasks each, with the tasks varying in terms of traffic conditions, number of trains and associated waiting times. This study shows that increased waiting times result in higher levels of frustration and an increased likelihood of risky driving behaviour, particularly for waiting times longer than 3â?¯min. Non-compliance included entering the activated crossing before boom gates are down, entering the crossing after the train passage but before signals are deactivated, stopping/reversing on the crossing. Subjective data revealed that participants did not comply with level crossing rules due to factors including time pressure, impatience/frustration and low perceived risk. The results suggest that, where possible, waiting times should be standardised at values lower than 3â?¯min to reduce the likelihood of risky road user behaviour.","Road safety, Rail safety, Railway level crossing, Congestion, Risky behaviour, Frustration",GrÃ©goire S.

"This study evaluated the effectiveness and acceptance of four connected vehicle features, i.e. Emergency Electronic Brake Lights (EEBL), Emergency Vehicle Warning (EVW), Roadworks warning (RWW) and Traffic Condition Warning (TCW) which were presented via a mobile phone mounted near the line of sight. A driving simulator study was conducted in which 36 drivers were exposed to different levels of urgent and critical situations. They involved the approach of an emergency vehicle, an emergency braking of a lead vehicle, a roadworks area and a congested section of a road. All these events took place in a simulated motorway scenario. In the EEBL event, the vehicle braking ahead with the brake lights on was either visible or not (between-subjects). Whereas no effect of RWW and TCW were observed on driving behaviour, results showed that drivers who were shown the EEBL warnings had shorter braking and decelerating response times, and a slower mean speed during the events, and this was independent of brake lights visibility. The EVW resulted in participants giving way to the emergency vehicle (i.e. staying on the slow lane instead of overtaking slower vehicles) more frequently than those who did not receive the warning. The mobile phone app was accepted and considered usable. Locating the mobile phone in different locations within the drivers' line of sight (i.e. dashboard, instrument cluster) did not impact significantly neither driversâ?? attitudes nor behaviour. Additional in-vehicle information systems could enhance safety and allow emergency vehicles to get faster to their destination.","Connected vehicle, Human machine interface, Mobile phone app, Road safety, Behaviour, Usability, Acceptance, Driving, Emergency electronic brake lights, Emergency vehicle warning, V2V, V2I",William Payre and Cyriel Diels,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018304745,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102932,0003-6870,2020,102932,82,Applied Ergonomics,"I want to brake free: The effect of connected vehicle features on driver behaviour, usability and acceptance",article,PAYRE2020102932
"Equivocal findings exist for the economy associated with load carried close to the body's centre of mass. Individual variation could explain some of the equivocal findings. This research aimed to examine the extent of individual variation in loaded walking economy. Eighteen females carried load on the back, head and split between the front and back. Individual variation in relative load carriage economy (ELI) was primarily assessed using standard deviation, coefficients of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). There was large inter-individual variation in ELI values with highest mean CV's of 16%, 12% and 10% for head-, back- and combined front and back-loading. Mean ELI values were not significantly different between methods. The large amount of individual variation found here suggests future load carriage research should account for individual variation, particularly when considering sample size and when making inferences on the economy associated with different types of load carriage using group mean data.","Load carriage, Economy, Physiology, Individual variation, Physical work",Sean Hudson and Carlton Cooke and Simeon Davies and Sacha West and Raeeq Gamieldien and Chris Low and Ray Lloyd,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701930184X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102968,0003-6870,2020,102968,82,Applied Ergonomics,Inter-individual variability in load carriage economy and comparisons between different load conditions,article,HUDSON2020102968
"Health and safety inductions are ubiquitous in construction but tend to be poorly designed and suffer low levels of worker engagement.

This evaluation examines the impact of EPIC from the perspective of participants and other stakeholders, and considers the utility of actor-based immersive health and safety inductions for use more widely, in both construction and other sectors. Using a mixed-method, longitudinal approach to data collection, EPIC is evaluated against Kirkpatrick's (1959) â??four levelsâ?? framework of reactions, learning, behaviour change and results.

"This study investigated the effects of cue plausibility in a baggage screening task. 120 participants had to indicate whether a prohibited item was present in a series of grey-scaled X-ray images of baggage. They were assisted by a support system, which pointed at the location of a suspicious object. A 2â?¯Ã?â?¯2â?¯Ã?â?¯2 between-subjects design was used. Cue plausibility for false alarms (i.e. how the cued object was similar to a prohibited item) and support system reliability were manipulated at two levels (high/low). Furthermore, half of participants were provided with a rationale about automation failures (RAF) to reduce their negative impact on trust and performance. The results showed lower performance and more compliance with automation suggestions when cues were implausible than plausible. The RAF increased the response time and did not improve detection performance. Overall, this suggests that effective (computer-based) training is needed to reduce the negative effect of plausible cues.","Automation ability, Screening performance, Trust",Alain Chavaillaz and Adrian Schwaninger and Stefan Michel and Juergen Sauer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018304873,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102916,0003-6870,2020,102916,82,Applied Ergonomics,Some cues are more equal than others: Cue plausibility for false alarms in baggage screening,article,CHAVAILLAZ2020102916
"Partially automated vehicles present interface design challenges in ensuring the driver remains alert should the vehicle need to hand back control at short notice, but without exposing the driver to cognitive overload. To date, little is known about driver expectations of partial driving automation and whether this affects the information they require inside the vehicle. Twenty-five participants were presented with five partially automated driving events in a driving simulator. After each event, a semi-structured interview was conducted. The interview data was coded and analysed using grounded theory. From the results, two groupings of driver expectations were identified: High Information Preference (HIP) and Low Information Preference (LIP) drivers; between these two groups the information preferences differed. LIP drivers did not want detailed information about the vehicle presented to them, but the definition of partial automation means that this kind of information is required for safe use. Hence, the results suggest careful thought as to how information is presented to them is required in order for LIP drivers to safely using partial driving automation. Conversely, HIP drivers wanted detailed information about the system's status and driving and were found to be more willing to work with the partial automation and its current limitations. It was evident that the drivers' expectations of the partial automation capability differed, and this affected their information preferences. Hence this study suggests that HMI designers must account for these differing expectations and preferences to create a safe, usable system that works for everyone.","Driving simulator, Qualitative, Autonomous vehicle, SAE level 2, Partial automation, Information preferences, HMI",Arun Ulahannan and Rebecca Cain and Simon Thompson and Lee Skrypchuk and Alex Mouzakitis and Paul Jennings and Stewart Birrell,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300365,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102969,0003-6870,2020,102969,82,Applied Ergonomics,User expectations of partial driving automation capabilities and their effect on information design preferences in the vehicle,article,ULAHANNAN2020102969
"Activity-based Flexible Offices (AFOs) are innovations in workspace design that are being increasingly implemented in organisations.

The aims of this study were to (i) identify workspace preferences and non-preferences in AFOs, and (ii) investigate whether employeesâ?? workstation choices support their activities and align with their preferences. Two Swedish municipalities participated in the study. Data collection involved 27 semi-structured interviews and annotations on architectural drawings. The results showed that the interviewees preferred workstations that were both desirable and functional, and avoided workstations that were undesirable. This was due to functional, social, emotional and symbolic aspects of the workspaces as well as their physical structure and stimuli.

"The objective of this study was to investigate biomechanical loads on the lumbar spine as a function of working in a confined vertical space, consistent with baggage handling inside the baggage compartment of an airplane. Ten male subjects performed baggage handling tasks using confined (kneeling, sitting) and unconfined (stooping) lifting styles. Dependent measures of torso flexion and three-dimensional spinal loads were assessed with an electromyography-driven biomechanical model. Lifting exertions typical to airline baggage handling posed significant risk to the lumbar spine, regardless of lifting style. Statistically significant differences attributable to lift style (stooping, kneeling, sitting) were not observed for peak compressive, lateral shear, or resultant spinal loads, but lifting while kneeling decreased anterior/posterior (A/P) shear spinal loads relative to stooping (pÂ =Â 0.02).

"Sit-stand desks can reduce occupational sitting time, however, their cost can limit scalability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a low-cost standing desk on objectively-measured occupational sitting and prolonged sitting bouts over 3- and 6-months. Secondary outcomes included self-report work engagement and occupational fatigue. Forty-eight office employees (91.7% female, Mageâ?¯=â?¯39.8â?¯Â±â?¯10.1) were randomized to receive a low-cost standing desk or to a control group. At 3-months, the intervention group sat 0.7â?¯h (42min) less at work compared to the control group; F(1, 45)â?¯=â?¯5.90, partial Î·2â?¯=â?¯0.12, pâ?¯=â?¯.019. The effect was small, yet comparable to findings from studies using costlier alternatives. However, these reductions were not maintained at 6-months. No changes in prolonged sitting bouts or secondary outcomes were found. There is some potential for low-cost standing desk converters as a scalable workplace health intervention.

"The study aims to assess the association between various levels of engagement in a worksite physical activities program and variables related to musculoskeletal symptoms, psychophysiological well-being, difficulty to perform tasks, willingness to work, and interpersonal relationships, among men and women in a footwear industry. This program involved 1113 workers. Data were analysed using an ordinal logistic regression model. In women, an increase in the frequency of participation in the worksite physical activities program was associated with less musculoskeletal pain (ORÂ =Â 3.12; 2.07â??4.71), better relationships among colleagues (ORÂ =Â 2.83; 1.67â??4.81), and a higher level of psychophysiological well-being (ORÂ =Â 1.98; 1.06â??3.70). In men, an increase in the frequency participation in the worksite physical activities program was associated with less difficulty in performing occupational tasks (ORÂ =Â 0.49; 0.27â??0.87).

"Multidisciplinary incident management teams (IMTs) are required to operate in resilient ways as emergency situations unfold unexpectedly. Although resilience in emergency management has been widely studied in many emergency contexts, the development of a new method to investigate actual resilient performance of the IMTs under realistic settings has been limited. To address such gap, this paper first introduces Interaction Episode Analysis (IEA), a novel approach to capture and describe emergent team performance. As an exploratory observation study, we apply the IEA to an information management aspect of the IMTs in two emergency exercises carried out in a high-fidelity environment. As a result, the IEA provides comparable sets of episodes as instances of work-as-done, rendering opportunities to further analyze essential elements of interactions between team members as well as information management activities. Moreover, the IEA enables comparisons between the observations and identification of challenges faced by the team in managing incident information and adaptive behaviors used to address the challenges. By gathering more evidences as well as addressing limitations identified in this study, the IEA is expected to serve as a method that facilitates the analysis of work-as-done of complex team work and the reconciliation between work-as-done and work-as-imagined to promote resilience in emergency management.","Emergency response, Resilience engineering, Episode analysis, Work-as-done",Changwon Son and Farzan Sasangohar and Timothy J.

"The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) is a computer based Go-No-Go response task. Participants respond to frequently occurring neutral stimuli and withhold responses to rare target stimuli. Researchers have suggested the inhibition demands of the SART may mirror those which occur in some firearm accidents. Participants in the present experiment used a simulated nonlethal weapon to subdue threats (images of people holding guns) on large screens. Participants completed a target rich task (high Go low No-Go, like a SART), a target sparse task (low Go/high No-Go), a verbal recall task, and dual versions of the target rich and target sparse tasks with the verbal recall task as the secondary task. Results provided further evidence that some accidental shootings may result from failures of response inhibition and that additional cognitive load is detrimental to overall performance. Future studies should explore the role of response inhibition in realistic firearm scenarios.","fratricide, Friendly-fire, Mindlessness, Motor control, Response inhibition, Sustained attention",Annabelle Munnik and Katharina NÃ¤swall and Graeme Woodward and William S.

"This paper evaluates a method for motion-based prediction of external forces and moments on manual material handling (MMH) tasks. From a set of hypothesized contact points between the subject and the environment (ground and load), external forces were calculated as the minimal forces at each contact point while ensuring the dynamics equilibrium. Ground reaction forces and moments (GRF&M) and load contact forces and moments (LCF&M) were computed from motion data alone. With an inverse dynamics method, the predicted data were then used to compute kinetic variables such as back loading. On a cohort of 65 subjects performing MMH tasks, the mean correlation coefficients between predicted and experimentally measured GRF for the vertical, antero-posterior and medio-lateral components were 0.91 (0.08), 0.95 (0.03) and 0.94 (0.08), respectively. The associated RMSE were 0.51â?¯N/kg, 0.22â?¯N/kg and 0.19â?¯N/kg. The correlation coefficient between L5/S1 joint moments computed from predicted and measured data was 0.95 with a RMSE of 14 Nm for the flexion/extension component. In conclusion, this method allows the assessment of MMH tasks without force platforms, which increases the ecological aspect of the tasks studied and enables performance of dynamic analyses in real settings outside the laboratory.","Ground reaction forces and moments, Lifting, Kinematics, Inverse dynamics, L5/S1 joint moment",A.

"There is increasing evidence that subjects who are exposed to long sitting periods suffer from musculoskeletal discomfort and back pain. The underlying mechanism and effective prevention strategies are still largely unknown. In this study, muscle stiffness of the back was measured in 59 office workers who followed their usual desk work regime for 4.5â?¯h in a sitting posture. The sitting period was either followed by an 8-min roller massage intervention or a controlled standing task. Results showed that muscle stiffness increased significantly after the 4.5â?¯h sitting period. When the sitting period was followed by roller massage, the stiffness values dropped slightly below baseline stiffness. In contrast, the stiffness values remained increased when the sitting period was followed by controlled standing. This study indicates that short-duration tissue manipulation can be an effective active break between prolonged sitting periods to prevent musculoskeletal issues, such as musculoskeletal discomfort and back pain.","Prolonged sitting, Muscle stiffness, Workplace intervention, Roller massage, Back muscles, Sedentary work",Alexander Robert Kett and Freddy Sichting,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701930167X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102947,0003-6870,2020,102947,82,Applied Ergonomics,Sedentary behaviour at work increases muscle stiffness of the back: Why roller massage has potential as an active break intervention,article,KETT2020102947
"Lifting equipment can reduce the risk of injury from patient handling, but limited availability and adoption have been a persistent problem. Data from statewide surveys of California nurses (Nâ?¯=â?¯389) in 2013 and 2016 were analyzed to evaluate lift use, perceptions about lifts and injury risk, and musculoskeletal symptoms by type of available lifts. Nurses with ceiling lifts (23%) were significantly more likely to use lifts and had more positive perceptions about lifts, regarding worker safety, patient safety and comfort, ease of use, access, and storing, than nurses with only floor lifts (77%). Nurses with ceiling lifts reported less low back pain and shoulder pain. Our study findings suggest that providing ceiling lifts can result in superior outcomes to floor-based lifts in multiple aspects, including better acceptance and use by nurses for patient handling, as well as being associated with reduced work-related musculoskeletal symptoms in the low back and shoulders.","Ceiling lift, Musculoskeletal symptoms, Patient lifting equipment",Soo-Jeong Lee and David Rempel,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301723,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102954,0003-6870,2020,102954,82,Applied Ergonomics,"Comparison of lift use, perceptions, and musculoskeletal symptoms between ceiling lifts and floor-based lifts in patient handling",article,LEE2020102954

"Sixty percent of the US population manages at least one chronic illness. For these patients, personal health information management (PHIM) is an integral part of daily life, and largely occurs within the home. However, the way in which the home supports PHIM has not been systematically investigated. The present study examined how members of the diabetic population use features of the home environment to support PHIM. Participants (Nâ?¯=â?¯60) explored a simulated home environment, the VR CAVE, and identified the most useful features for performing three examples of PHIM tasks. The computer was perceived as the most useful feature for PHIM. However, perceived usefulness of features varied based on the PHIM task performed and the rooms in which features appeared. We conclude that a detailed study of the affordances of features is necessary to ease the burden of managing chronic illness, particularly diabetes mellitus, in the sociotechnical system of the home.","Personal health information management, Sociotechnical systems, Chronic illness, Virtual reality",Anna F.

"Signal passed at danger (SPAD) events have been a perennial issue in rail and requires continued scholarship. Much of the literature has tended to focus on activities within the train cab, placing the spotlight on â??errorâ? within the rail driving role; however a train is not propelled by a single person but by a team. This study set out to understand how network controllers perceive the relationship dynamic between the network controller and rail driver, and how these views shape system performance. Using a phenomenological approach underpinned by Joint Cognitive Systems theory, interviews were conducted with network controllers (Nâ?¯=â?¯55) across 8 rail organisations in Australia and New Zealand to examine how they related to signals and to drivers. Sixteen different perspectives were identified ranging in type and varying by frequency, each with implications for coupling strength between the controller and driver roles and on system performance. Key dimensions of teamwork in train movement were emphasised, illustrating how the underlying values and philosophies in different network controlling cultures influence risk perception. The findings may be used to develop a more informed understanding of the â??controller-signal-driver-trainâ?? system and pave the way for strategies that can embrace diversity in different perspectives whilst optimizing system safety and performance.","Network controllers, Team dynamics, Rail drivers, SPAD-Risk, Complexity",Anjum Naweed,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018305696,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102976,0003-6870,2020,102976,82,Applied Ergonomics,Getting mixed signals: Connotations of teamwork as performance shaping factors in network controller and rail driver relationship dynamics,article,NAWEED2020102976
"Powered two-wheeler riders are frequently involved in crashes at intersections because an approaching car driver fails to give right of way. This simulator study aimed to investigate how riders perform an emergency braking maneuver in response to an oncoming car and, second, whether longitudinal motion cues provided by a motion platform influence riders' braking performance. Twelve riders approached a four-way intersection at the same time as an oncoming car. We manipulated the car's direction of travel, speed profile, and its indicator light. The results showed that the more dangerous the situation (safe, near-miss, impending-crash), the more likely riders were to initiate braking. Although riders braked in the majority of trials when the car crossed their path, they were often unsuccessful in avoiding a collision with the car. No statistically significant differences were found in riders' initiation of braking and braking style between the motion and no-motion simulator configurations.","Perception-action, Rider performance, Hazard, Motorcycle-car interaction, Motorcyclist safety",NatÃ¡lia KovÃ¡csovÃ¡ and Marco Grottoli and Francesco Celiberti and Yves Lemmens and Riender Happee and Marjan P.

"Occupant discomfort, induced by vibration transmitted through a vehicle seat, can be evaluated by measuring vibration on the contact interface between the occupant and seat. In the previous study (Ittianuwat et al., 2016), measuring five contact points of the back-backrest, including centre point (ISO 2631-1), was considered as an important factor for assessing occupant comfort in frequencies where seat structure resonances occur. To enhance occupant vibration comfort in the early seat design stage, predicting the dynamic response of the coupled human-seat system on various contact locations is necessary. In this study, a low order seated human body Finite Element (FE) model was developed for predicting vibration transmissibility of the human-seat system in frequencies up to 30â?¯Hz. Throughout the optimization process, the parameters of the model were obtained by comparing measured transmissibilities of the occupied vehicle seat system. The human-seat system vibration modes were also compared and verified with measured data by calculating MAC (Modal Assurance Criterion). The results showed that two human body vibration modes coupled with foam were observed below 10â?¯Hz, and two coupled human and seat structure fore-aft modes were observed at around 20.1â?¯Hz and 21.9â?¯Hz. Fore-aft transmissibility of the model at various locations of contact provided reasonable correlation with the measured data. The developed low order human model enables the prediction of the fore-aft transmissibility on various back-backrest contact locations up to 30â?¯Hz. This showed the capability of improving occupant's vibration comfort by predicting transmissibilities of the human-seat system in the early stage of developing a new vehicle seat.","Human-seat system, Finite element modelling, Transmissibility, Resonance frequency, Mode shape, Whole-body vibration",Eunyeong Kim and Mohammad Fard and Kazuhito Kato,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301565,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102929,0003-6870,2020,102929,84,Applied Ergonomics,A seated human model for predicting the coupled human-seat transmissibility exposed to fore-aft whole-body vibration,article,KIM2020102929
"The aim was to describe occupational physical activity (OPA) and examine the role of psychosocial job resources among blue-collar workers. In a sample of 198 workers (57% male; mean age 44.9 (SD 9.9) year) from 7 companies in Denmark, two accelerometers (Actigraph) were placed on the thigh and trunk during 1â??5 consecutive days, to determine working time spent standing, walking, on feet and in activity of moderate to vigorous intensity level (MVPA). The level of influence and social support at work were assessed by questionnaire. The exposure to OPA significantly varied by particular job type, especially in male predominant occupations. Overall, psychosocial job resources did not affect the exposure to OPA. These findings suggest that workplace interventions aiming to prevent adverse outcomes of OPA among blue-collars workers ought to focus on task redesign and target work organizational factors related to specific job type.","Occupational physical activity, Psychosocial, Blue-collar, Work organization, Objective measurement",Els Clays and David Hallman and Jodi Oakman and Andreas Holtermann,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301681,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102948,0003-6870,2020,102948,82,Applied Ergonomics,"Objectively measured occupational physical activity in blue-collar workers: What is the role of job type, gender and psychosocial resources?",article,CLAYS2020102948
"Many workplace falls occur during tasks involving carrying a load with both hands. Successful balance and gait during bimanual load carrying may be attributed to the adaptability of a system to navigate changing environments (e.g. construction site). This study investigates how bimanual load carrying affects adaptability of balance and gait, using 0%, 5%, and 10% of body mass in 14 young adults. Regularity of balance, and measures of range and center of pressure distance, and gait measures of stride length and step width were quantified using sample entropy. When carrying 5% load, anterior-posterior balance became less adaptable relative to 0%. As load increased from 0% to 5%â??10%, step width narrowed and variability increased significantly, indicating possible increased fall risk while walking. Healthy, young adults may be at an increased risk of falls when carrying a load due to a loss in adaptability in a dynamic workplace environment.","Load carrying, Gait, entropy",Sidney T.

"Purpose The aim of the present study was to identify the most physically demanding work tasks for Swedish ground combat soldiers through the development and application of a questionnaire survey. This is the first in a series of studies aiming to describe the development process and validation of physical selection standards in the Swedish armed forces. Methods Based on procedural documentation, combat manuals and job analyses, a questionnaire was developed that defined and rated the perceived physical strain of 30 work tasks for ground combat soldiers. To assess validity, an expert focus group was used and psychometric analysis performed. The questionnaire was then distributed to 231 ground combat soldiers, of whom 165 responded (71%). Results The questionnaire was validated in three steps to achieve face and content validity, and internal consistency was acceptable (Chronbach's alpha â?¥0.95). Of the 30 work tasks included in the survey, transport of wounded was rated as the most demanding task for both aerobic capacity and strength. Other highly demanding tasks for aerobic capacity included combat movement (low/high crawl), dismounted attack in close country, urban and rough terrain and carrying heavy loads. There were no gender differences for either aerobic or strength demands in the top five most challenging tasks based on proportions. Conclusions This study identified the most physically demanding tasks performed in the Swedish ground combat forces. Almost all the physically demanding tasks found in the present study contain elements of lifting and carrying, which require muscular strength and muscular endurance, with no gender differences.","Ground combat soldiers, Work-demands, Physical demand, Aerobic capacity",Jonas Larsson and Magnus Dencker and M.

"This study investigated the ergonomics of three simulated 120Â m vertical ladder ascents and differences between novice (NC) and experienced climbers (EC). Seven EC and 10 NC undertook three 120Â m climbs; comprising of four 30Â m climbs. Ascending 120Â m was reported as a high physical demand, supported by high peak HRs (~173Â b.minâ??1 across the three climbs) and VË? O2 (~3.1 L.minâ??1 across the three climbs). Grip strength and endurance were significantly (pÂ <Â 0.05) impaired by ascents. With multiple ascents, toe clearance was reduced (Climb 1 â?? 0.0515Â m; Climb 3 â?? 0.046Â m), and participants reached higher with their arms (shoulder angle: Climb 1 â?? 117Â°; Climb 3 â?? 136Â°). NC demonstrated less range of movement through the hips (NC â?? 46Â°; EC â?? 58Â°), and higher muscle activation in the upper body (NC â?? 60%; EC â?? 49%).

Experiment 2 tested non-clinician participants' identification of 48 single-patient spearcons while they performed no concurrent task, reading, listening, and saying linguistic tasks. In Experiment 1 the saying task worsened participants' identification of spearcons compared with no concurrent task or reading. In Experiment 2, the saying and listening tasks reduced participants' accuracy at identifying spearcons, but the reading task did not. Listening affected identification accuracy no differently than the saying task did. Concurrent auditory linguistic tasks worsen participantsâ?? identification of spearcons, probably due to auditory modality interference in verbal working memory.","Auditory displays, Spearcons, Patient monitoring",Thomas Davidson and Youn Ji Ryu and Birgit Brecknell and Robert Loeb and Penelope Sanderson,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301280,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102895,0003-6870,2019,102895,81,Applied Ergonomics,The impact of concurrent linguistic tasks on participantsâ?? identification of spearcons,article,DAVIDSON2019102895
"In contrast to the conventional safety philosophy (Safety-I) which focuses on â??what goes wrongâ??, a newborn one (Safety-II) focusing on â??what goes rightâ?? endows people with more opportunities to realize productive safety in complex socio-technical systems. Yet, it is challenging to make the best of both the philosophies in a period of knowledge transition when they may have to coexist. This work investigates how Safety-II may resemble, differ from, and correlate to Safety-I. From individual, environmental and organizational aspects, 9 impacting factors are identified and expounded comparatively in the two philosophies. To examine impact of the factors on accidents and resilience respectively, an empirical approach is presented in the context of Beijing taxi service system (BTSS). Multiple means such as questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interviews, and statistical analysis with bi-method (Correlation Analysis, and Data Envelopment Analysis) cross-checking are utilized comprehensively to support the empirical study. The results show that: a) individual factors play a dominant role in system risk/performance management, in respect to views of both Safety-I and II; and b) organizational factors are more influential in creating and maintaining system resilience. Based on the findings, possible patterns of integrating the two philosophies are instantiated through mutually complementary application to BTSS. Despite the context of BTSS, this work provides a feasible way of comparing between Safety-I and Safety-II, for beneficial reference of other socio-technical systems.","Safety-II, Resilience engineering, Accident, Empirical research",Feng Wang and Jin Tian and Zheying Lin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701930170X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102952,0003-6870,2020,102952,82,Applied Ergonomics,Empirical study of gap and correlation between philosophies Safety-I and Safety-II: A case of Beijing taxi service system,article,WANG2020102952
"Firefighting is a dangerous occupation and even training carries substantial risks. Self-contained breathing apparatus confidence courses (SCBACC) are a common type of training. Purpose Compare the physiological strain of SCBACC to live-fire training (LFT) and circuit training (CT) among academy cadets. Methods Cadets wore physiologic status monitors to assess heart rate (HR) and estimated core temperature (ECT) during CT, LFT, and SCBACC of similar duration (33â??38â?¯min). Results Data from 52 cadet firefighters (28â?¯Â±â?¯4â?¯yrs old) were analyzed. ECT (38.6â?¯Â±â?¯0.4 vs 39.3â?¯Â±â?¯0.7 vs. 39.3â?¯Â±â?¯0.6áµ?C), peak HR (182.6â?¯Â±â?¯9.1 vs. 192.7â?¯Â±â?¯9.5 vs 195.9â?¯Â±â?¯9.6 bpm), and age-predicted maximal HR (APMHR%; 94.6â?¯Â±â?¯4.6 vs 99.9â?¯Â±â?¯4.9 vs. 101.5â?¯Â±â?¯4.8%) were significantly (pâ?¯<â?¯0.05) lower for CT than SCBACC and LFT, respectively. Conclusions SCBACC produced physiological strain greater than CT and similar to LFT. SCBACC resulted in sustained HR at 100% of age-predicted maximal values, a peak ECT of 39.3â?¯Â°C, and should be considered as physiologically stressful as LFT.","Firefighting, Fire fighter, Estimated core temperature, Heat stress",Andrea F.

"This study aims (1) to test the validity of a new non-invasive core thermometer, CosinussÂ°, in rest and (2) during firefighting simulation tasks, against invasive temperature pill and inner-ear temperature and (3) to compare the change in core temperature of firefighters when working in two types of protective clothing (traditional turnout gear versus new concept). 11 active firefighters performed twice a selection of tasks during their periodic preventive medical examination and a fire-extinguishing task. Without correction no correlation between the CosinussÂ° and thermometer pill (ICCâ?¤0.09, pâ?¯â?¥â?¯0.154, LoAâ?¥1.37) and a moderate correlation between CosinussÂ° and inner-ear infrared (ICCâ?¯=â?¯0.40, pâ?¯=â?¯0.044, LoAÂ±1.20) was observed. With individual correction both correlations were excellent (ICCâ?¥0.84, pâ?¯=â?¯0.000, LoAâ?¤0.30). However, during and after working all correlations were poor and non-significant (ICCâ?¤0.38, pâ?¯â?¥â?¯0.091, LoAâ?¥1.71).

"In many sectors, designers have to develop products that are creative, and thus both new and adapted to the context. They can use a variety of methods to favor their creative design activities, including a new one that we have developed, featuring dynamic personas. This method allows participants to interact in real time in a virtual space with an avatar that represents an archetypal future user and provides them with information about this future user throughout the interactions. In the present experimental study, we compared this method with the classic (or static) persona method, by asking 102 participants to perform a creative design task. Results revealed statistical differences between the use of the static and dynamic persona methods, and highlighted the advantages of the dynamic method over the static one. We discuss the prospects for using this method in an ecological setting and identify the aspects to be improved.","Design, Creativity, Personas",Nathalie Bonnardel and Nicolas Pichot,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018305623,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102949,0003-6870,2020,102949,82,Applied Ergonomics,Enhancing collaborative creativity with virtual dynamic personas,article,BONNARDEL2020102949
"In this article, we analyse flight crew response to an in-flight powerplant system malfunction (PSM) using control task analysis. We demonstrate the application of the decision ladder template and the skills, rules, and knowledge (SRK) framework to this new area of inquiry. Despite the high reliability of turbofan engines, accidents and incidents involving PSM still occur. During these unusual events, flight crew have not always responded appropriately, leading to a reduction in safety margins or disruption of operations. This article proposes recommendations for technological and information system that can support flight crew in responding safely and appropriately to a PSM. These recommendations focus on new ways in which information from engine health monitoring system and other sources of data can be utilised and displayed. Firstly, we conducted knowledge elicitation using Critical Decision Method (CDM) interviews with airline pilots who have experienced real or simulated PSM events. We then developed generic decision ladders using the interview data, operations manual, training manual, and other guideline documents. The generic decision ladders characterise the different stages of responding to PSM identified as part of the research. These stages include: regaining and maintaining control of aircraft, identifying PSM and selecting appropriate checklists to secure the engine, and modifying the flight plan. Using the decision ladders and insights from the CDM interviews, we were able to identify cognitive processes and states that are more prone to errors and therefore more likely to generate an inappropriate response. Using the SRK framework, we propose design recommendations for technological and information systems to minimise the likelihood of such inappropriate response. We conclude that this combination of methods provides a structured and reliable approach to identifying system improvements in complex and dynamic work situations. Our specific contributions are the application of these techniques in the unrepresented area of flight operations, and the development of evidence-based design recommendations to improve flight crew response to in-flight powerplant system malfunctions.","Cognitive work analysis, Flight crew decision-making, Aircraft engine malfunction",Saryani Asmayawati and Jim Nixon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301711,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102953,0003-6870,2020,102953,82,Applied Ergonomics,Modelling and supporting flight crew decision-making during aircraft engine malfunctions: developing design recommendations from cognitive work analysis,article,ASMAYAWATI2020102953
"Introduction The aim of this paper is to examine gender differences in the occurrence of accidents among workers while walking to or from their workplace (non-vehicle commuting accidents). We have previously found that the lower limb is more often injured at work among women, compared to men, so the paper concentrates on lower limb injuries. Methods Using the records of the National Institute for Insurance against Injuries at Work (INAIL), we focused on the non-vehicle commuting accidents of women and men recognized as work-related for the period 2013-2017. In particular, we examined the gender difference by work sector and type of trauma suffered with particular attention to lower limb injuries. Results The rate of non-vehicle commuting accidents (n. 60,936) among women was significantly higher than for men (1.29â?° vs 0.40â?° men, pâ?¯<â?¯0.001) for the period studied. Lower limb injuries (50.5% for women and 43.7% for men, pâ?¯<â?¯0.001) constituted the large majority of these injuries. In particular, dislocation of the ankle (78% for women vs 65.5% for men, pâ?¯<â?¯0.001), bruise of the knee (71.2% for women vs 54.9% for men, pâ?¯<â?¯0.001) and fracture of the foot (41% for women vs 33.6% for men, pâ?¯<â?¯0.001) were all significantly higher among women. The work sectors with higher injury rates were: Transport and Warehouse, Public Administration, Health and care services and Wholesale and retail trade. This result may be due to wear and tear from conditions at work. The women injured were on the average, a decade older than men (50-59 vs 40-49 years old). Conclusions Non-vehicle commuting represents an important, albeight neglected, preventable risk for women workers, causing lower limb trauma particularly at the ankle, the foot and the knee. These areas may be particularly injure-prone among women in specific sectors, due to the work environment. Effective prevention of these injuries requires gender-oriented ergonomic actions at work and in the commuting environment.","Non-vehicle commuting accidents, Lower limb, Women",Silvana Salerno and Claudia Giliberti,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301954,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102982,0003-6870,2020,102982,83,Applied Ergonomics,Non-vehicle commuting in Italy: need for ergonomic action for women's lower limbs?,article,SALERNO2020102982
"This study investigated the effects of aerial ladder rung spacing on firefighter climbing biomechanics. Ten female and 9 male firefighters ascended and descended instrumented ladders with rungs spaced at 356â?¯mm (current design) and 305â?¯mm in a laboratory setup. The climbing tests were performed at five ladder slope and handrail conditions: 30Â° with low (305â?¯mm) and high (914â?¯mm) handrails, 52.5Â° with and without a low handrail, and 75Â° without a handrail. Foot and hand forces and body movements were recorded and used to calculate joint moments of the upper and lower body. Reduced rung spacing resulted in reduced foot forces, reduced hand forces, and reduced ankle transverse moment. It was also associated with increased climbing speed for female climbers, and increased ankle vertical overshoot. The results indicate that reduced rung spacing on aerial ladders may lead to lower biomechanical stress; better climbing efficiency and safety; and reduced climbing speed disparity across sexes.","Aerial ladder, Rung spacing, Climbing biomechanics",Peter Simeonov and Hongwei Hsiao and Thomas Armstrong and Qianyi Fu and Charles Woolley and Tsui-Ying Kau,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301437,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102911,0003-6870,2020,102911,82,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of aerial ladder rung spacing on firefighter climbing biomechanics,article,SIMEONOV2020102911
"There is a growing body of studies indicating that extended shift duration has an adverse effect on fatigue, consequently leading to reduced work performance and higher risk of accident. Following modern fatigue risk management systems (FRMS), acceptable performance could be maintained by the mobilization of appropriate mitigation strategies. However, the effective deployment of such strategies assume that workers are able to assess their own level of fatigue-related impairments. In this study, we sought to determine whether emergency physiciansâ?? subjective feelings of sleepiness could provide accurate knowledge of actual fatigue-related impairments while working extended shifts. We conducted a prospective observational study with a within-subjects repeated measures component. We collected sleep logs, sleepiness ratings and reaction times on a Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) at different time points during shifts. Our results show that the PVT is sensitive to sleep loss and fatigue, with a 10% increase in mean reaction time across the shift. Subjective sleepiness, however, showed no significant association with time since awakening and was not a significant predictor of PVT performance. Our results are consistent with experimental studies showing that individuals tend to underestimate fatigue-related impairments when sleep deprived or functioning under adverse circadian phase. The discrepancy between subjective sleepiness and actual fatigue-related impairments may give workers the illusion of being in control and hinder the deployment of mitigation strategies. Further research is needed to determine the relative weight of circadian phase shifting and cumulative sleep deprivation in the decline of self-knowledge in extended shifts.","Extended shift, Sleepiness, Sustained attention, Emergency physician, Self-knowledge",Pierre Berastegui and Mathieu Jaspar and Alexandre Ghuysen and Anne-Sophie Nyssen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018306318,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102914,0003-6870,2020,102914,82,Applied Ergonomics,Fatigue-related risk perception among emergency physicians working extended shifts,article,BERASTEGUI2020102914
"The advent of electronic documentation systems has made it easy to generate and store vast amounts of information, and has enabled easy access to patient care information, so much so that they are now considered a critical infrastructure for supporting the cognitive tasks in healthcare work. But, electronic documentation systems are not without their share of problems. Accountability and liability requirements have made electronic information creation and documentation particularly challenging. Mandatory documentation requirements and templated electronic formats have increased the amount of information, but have not always resulted in reliable, useful, or meaningful information. Documentation systems have become rigid, offering little opportunity for healthcare providers to engage in meaningful conversations about the information, and to sense problem status without additional coordination. A particularly significant information interaction problem that we have identified from our field work in healthcare information modeling, which this paper focuses on, deals with what we term creator-consumer interaction behaviors. The purpose of this paper is to examine in-depth the problem of creator-consumer information interaction behaviors in electronic healthcare documentation systems. A creator-consumer interaction behavioral framework highlights satisficing behavior during creation and consumption of medical documentation, and the characteristics of the work system that may lead to satisficing on documentation tasks.","Documentation, Electronic health records, Satisficing, Information, Safety",Priyadarshini R.

"A recent systematic review identified 73 empirical studies that linked human factors (HF) with manufacturing quality. Human fatigue was noted as a frequent (nâ?¯=â?¯26) issue in the HF-quality relationship â?? a finding that warrants closer examination. We extend this review by investigating the relationship between fatigue and manufacturing quality by identifying how fatigue has been conceptualized and measured, and we attempted to quantify their relationship. From the original database, 12 of 26 relevant studies (46%) indicated that physical fatigue was the primary contributor to observed quality deficits. There was a positive relationship between fatigue and quality deficits, with fatigue accounting up to 42% of the variance. More studies are needed to improve the resolution, specificity, and power of these analyses. This study sheds light on the role of HF and human fatigue effects on manufacturing quality with macroergonomic implications for embedding HF aspects into design and quality assurance processes.","Systematic review, System performance, Quality assurance, Ergonomics",Marcus Yung and Ahmet Kolus and Richard Wells and W.

"Last (and First) mile deliveries are an increasingly important and costly component of supply chains especially those that require transport within city centres. With reduction in anticipated manufacturing and delivery timescales, logistics personnel are expected to identify the correct location (accurately) and supply the goods in appropriate condition (safe delivery). Moving towards more environmentally sustainable supply chains, the last/first mile of deliveries may be completed by a cyclist courier which could result in significant reductions in congestion and emissions in cities. In addition, the last metres of an increasing number of deliveries are completed on foot i.e. as a pedestrian. Although research into new technologies to support enhanced navigation capabilities is ongoing, the focus to date has been on technical implementations with limited studies addressing how information is perceived and actioned by a human courier. In the research reported in this paper a comparison study has been conducted with 24 participants evaluating two examples of state-of-the-art navigation aids to support accurate (right time and place) and safe (right condition) navigation. Participants completed 4 navigation tasks, 2 whilst cycling and 2 whilst walking. The navigation devices under investigation were a handheld display presenting a map and instructions and an in-sight monocular display presenting text and arrow instructions. Navigation was conducted in a real-world environment in which eye movements and device interaction were recorded using Tobii-Pro 2 eye tracking glasses. The results indicate that the handheld device provided better support for accurate navigation (right time and place), with longer but less frequent gaze interactions and higher perceived usability. The in-sight display supported improved situation awareness with a greater number of hazards acknowledged. The benefits and drawbacks of each device and use of visual navigation support tools are discussed.","Navigation, Eye-tracking, Map, Handheld device, In-sight display, Cycling, Pedestrian, Hazard perception",Katherine {van Lopik} and Maren Schnieder and Richard Sharpe and Murray Sinclair and Chris Hinde and Paul Conway and Andrew West and Martin Maguire,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301553,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102928,0003-6870,2020,102928,82,Applied Ergonomics,Comparison of in-sight and handheld navigation devices toward supporting industry 4.0 supply chains: First and last mile deliveries at the human level,article,VANLOPIK2020102928
"Recent technical advances have enabled the creation of mobile dialysis device prototypes. These prototypes have been tested for their ability to allow an individual to be dialyzed continuously rather than sporadically. The most recent prototype of a mobile dialysis device aims at increased functionality, which suggests that human factors issues (e.g., efficiency, bulkiness, and weight) are now considered carefully. This study describes advances in the design of an Ambulatory Kidney to Improve Vitality (AKTIV), using an interview protocol during the early stages of product development to capture patients' and caregivers' reactions. The AKTIV has the potential to improve patients' quality of life and decrease mortality rates. The goal of our study is to examine patients' and caregiversâ?? design preferences and feature considerations for an AKTIV. We interviewed 22 participants (age MÂ =Â 57.50, SDÂ =Â 13.30), of whom 12 were female and 16 were patients. A pre-interview survey was distributed to the participants, and semi-structured interviews were subsequently held. The pre-interview results show that the belt and backpack designs were preferred over the shoulder bag and distributed designs. The participants also indicated on their pre-interview forms that safety and accuracy were more important to them than attachment ease, comfort, compactness, or operational simplicity. Invisibility and mobility were frequently mentioned when determining the strengths of each of the five design types during the interviews. Finally, individual differences in preferences for the various design types and attributes were identified. The results from our study have important implications for improving efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction in relation to AKTIV prototypes and products. The findings from this interview study will help to ensure engineers and clinicians have target parameters for redesigning the AKTIV.","Human factors, Mobile dialysis devices, Interviewing, ESRD, Wearable medical devices",Ji-Eun Kim and Larry Kessler and Zach McCauley and Itsumi Niiyama and Linda Ng Boyle,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019302121,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.103003,0003-6870,2020,103003,85,Applied Ergonomics,Human factors considerations in designing a personalized mobile dialysis device: An interview study,article,KIM2020103003
"Focussed ultrasound can be used to create the sensation of touch in mid-air. Combined with gestures, this can provide haptic feedback to guide users, thereby overcoming the lack of agency associated with pure gestural interfaces, and reducing the need for vision â?? it is therefore particularly apropos of the driving domain. In a counter-balanced 2â?¯Ã?â?¯2 driving simulator study, a traditional in-vehicle touchscreen was compared with a virtual mid-air gestural interface, both with and without ultrasound haptics. Forty-eight experienced drivers (28 male, 20 female) undertook representative in-vehicle tasks â?? discrete target selections and continuous slider-bar manipulations â?? whilst driving. Results show that haptifying gestures with ultrasound was particularly effective in reducing visual demand (number of long glances and mean off-road glance time), and increasing performance (shortest interaction times, highest number of correct responses and least â??overshootsâ??) associated with continuous tasks. In contrast, for discrete, target-selections, the touchscreen enabled the highest accuracy and quickest responses, particularly when combined with haptic feedback to guide interactions, although this also increased visual demand. Subjectively, the gesture interfaces invited higher ratings of arousal compared to the more familiar touch-surface technology, and participants indicated the lowest levels of workload (highest performance, lowest frustration) associated with the gesture-haptics interface. In addition, gestures were preferred by participants for continuous tasks. The study shows practical utility and clear potential for the use of haptified gestures in the automotive domain.","Ultrasound, Mid-air haptics, Gestures, Visual demand, Touchscreen, Driving",David R.

"Interventional radiologists are at increased risk for musculoskeletal discomfort/disorders and this has been linked to the use of radiation personal protective equipment (rPPE). This study examined the effects of rPPE on the development of fatigue of the erector spinae and trapezius muscles. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to capture muscle activity, and both time domain (average rectified value) and frequency domain (median frequency) measures were considered in the assessment of localized muscle fatigue. Sixteen participants performed a simulated surgical procedure requiring intermittent 30Â° flexed static trunk posture with and without rPPE on separate days. The results showed that the rPPE condition demonstrated significantly greater (pÂ <Â 0.05) downward shift in median frequency in the left lumbar erector spinae and left lower thoracic erector spinae consistent with task-induced localized muscle fatigue.

"Understanding the demands of balance recovery on stairs is important for developing strategies to prevent falls on stairs. This study characterized recovery strategies and whole-body movement following unexpected backward balance loss during stair descent in twelve young adults. Following balance loss, peak downward COM velocity was approximately double that experienced during non-perturbation stair descent. Participants used several balance recovery strategies: harness reliance (nâ?¯=â?¯1), no grasping reaction (nâ?¯=â?¯3), and grasping some environmental feature (nâ?¯=â?¯8). Of the five participants who used the handrail, four demonstrated grasping errors. Peak resultant handrail forces ranged from 24.2N to 238.3N.

"â??Safety-IIâ?? is a new approach to safety, which emphasizes learning proactively about how safety and efficacy are achieved in everyday frontline work. Previous research developed a new lesson-sharing tool designed based on the Safety-II approach: Resilience Engineering Tool to Improve Patient Safety (RETIPS). The tool comprises questions designed to elicit narratives of adaptations that have contributed to effectiveness in care delivery. The purpose of this study is to revise and validate the design of RETIPS. The tool was revised based on feedback of clinicians at a large multi-specialty hospital, resulting in a version customized for anesthesia residents, RETIPS-AnRes. RETIPS-AnRes was administered on a pilot-basis to anesthesia resident groups for a limited period of time. A review of the reports obtained shows a strong alignment of responses with the conceptual basis of the tool, i.e. learning about how things go well in everyday work. The exemplars include both, specific instances of successful patient care, as well as generic routines that contribute to safe and/or effective care delivery.

"We aim to use a macrocognition theoretical perspective to characterize contributors to diagnostic delays by physicians that can be mitigated by work system redesign. As experienced with other complex, sociotechnical domains, system redesign is anticipated to be more effective at improving safety than training-based solutions. In the outpatient care setting, complex tasks, conducted by a primary care provider, are provided for five macrocognition functions: sensemaking, re-planning, detecting problems, deciding, and coordinating. Redesigning systems could reduce delays to diagnosis by helping users to avoid missed symptoms, forgotten follow-up activities, and delayed actions. Health information technology could support resilience strategies by offloading documentation burdens, recording working diagnoses, displaying planned follow-up activities at the correct time interval, and supporting recognition of patterns in patient care. These insights suggest a path forward for future research on system design innovations to reduce diagnostic delays, and ultimately, reduce patient harm.","Patient harm, Delayed diagnosis, Medical informatics, Ambulatory care, Human factors",Emily S.

"In the present research, models based on multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) are proposed to study the influence of gender in the factors affecting the development of shoulders, neck and upper limb MSD. Two different MARS models, corresponding to men and women, are constructed to identify variables with the strongest effect on the target MSD. Both models are capable to predict successfully the occurrence of the studied disorders. Men seem to be more vulnerable to physical risk factors and some other working conditions, whereas women appear to be more affected by psychosocial risk factors and activities carried out outside their working hours.

The Binder Liftâ?¢, the Simple Strap, and the Slip Preventer were used to lift patient actors, and were compared to current lifting methods. Postural data and the peak dynamic spine shear forces at the L5/S1 level were reduced when using the Simple Strap, the Binder Lift, and the Simulated Inflatable Seat. The Slip Preventer reduced spine flexion when the Binder Lift was not used. In summary, the tested devices can potentially reduce the biomechanical loads experienced by EMS providers as they lift and move patients.","Firefighter, EMS, Ergonomics, Patient handling, Injury prevention",Steven A.

"Background Consumer virtual reality (VR) devices are becoming more prevalent in the market, but cybersickness induced by VR devices limits their potential application and promotion. Acustimulation has been found effective in reducing cybersickness symptoms. However, in previous forms, the more effective way of acustimulation is either intrusive or electrical which is hard to be applied to daily VR use. Purpose In this study, we aimed to find a both simple and more effective acustimulation approach, acupressure plus acupaste (AcP+) to reducing the adverse effects caused by cybersickness from VR applications. Method In this study, we set three conditions: acupressure plus acupaste (AcP+) (main condition of interest), acupressure with fake acupaste (AcP), and a no acustimulation condition (NoAcP). In AcP and AcPÂ +Â conditions, we applied acupressure or acupressure with true acupaste on P6 point before conducting video-watching tasks using VR headsets, while in NoAcP condition, participants received no special treatment before video-watching tasks. We used questionnaires to measure symptoms of cybersickness and compared the results between these 3 conditions, especially between acupressure plus acupaste (AcP+) and acupressure (AcP) to examine the effect of AcP+, and compared AcP and AcP+ with NoAcP to confirm the effect of acustimulation. Result Participants reported significant fewer symptoms of cybersickness nausea feelings in both acustimulation methods, compared with NoAcP; and AcP+ was more effective than AcP against cybersickness on visual oculomotor aspect, and facilitated cybersickness recovery. Implication It would be promising to develop acupressure equipment and apply stimulation before VR application to reduce cybersickness.","VR headset, Cybersickness, Acustimulation",Ruijun Liu and Chu Zhuang and Rui Yang and Liang Ma,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301668,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102946,0003-6870,2020,102946,82,Applied Ergonomics,Effect of economically friendly acustimulation approach against cybersickness in video-watching tasks using consumer virtual reality devices,article,LIU2020102946
"The automotive industry is chugging along towards full autonomy, with a yet unknown time of arrival. The next call, however, is partial driving automation. At this interim station lurks many dangers, there-among them issues surrounding the partial performance of the driving task. Despite their potential for increased safety, these systems come with many inherent limitations and caveats, and their safe use depend on drivers correctly understanding their new role. Training is proposed as a potentially effective method of introducing drivers to the central aspects in this human-automation interaction. A proof-of-concept training program designed to introduce drivers to a partial automation system was developed. The effects of training were then evaluated through a between-group mixed-methods simulator experiment. Results indicate that trained drivers both self-report and exhibit an improved understanding of the automation system. They also report a significantly higher inclination to retake control in critical situation, than do their untrained counterparts.","Human-automation interaction, Driver training, Driving experience",Martin Krampell and Ignacio SolÃ­s-Marcos and Magnus HjÃ¤lmdahl,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018303211,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102986,0003-6870,2020,102986,83,Applied Ergonomics,Driving automation state-of-mind: Using training to instigate rapid mental model development,article,KRAMPELL2020102986
"In the last decades, a number of studies have examined people's perceptual and attentional capabilities using flat screen displays. The completion of studies using curved displays/screens has been neglected so far, despite their advantage of creating a more immersive and life-like experience. In two studies, we analysed possible performance differences between subjects' perceptual and attentional capabilities during a decision-making task whilst viewing life-size stimuli on large flat and curved immersive screens. In Study 1, participants performed an attention-demanding shape discrimination task. In Study 2, participants performed a more naturalistic football-specific discrimination task. Results of both studies revealed no differences in perception and decision making between screen conditions, but that attention can be directed across greater visual angles on immersive screens compared to flat screens. The findings suggest that attention can be directed across a larger visual angle on curved screens compared to flat screens probably because curved screens distort the image less than flat screens. This study has implications for the use of flat screens in studies that examine perceptual and attentional capabilities in the visual periphery.","Attentional distortions, Focus of attention, Football discrimination task",Stefanie Klatt and Nicholas J.

"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different target locations on musculoskeletal loading and task performance during virtual reality (VR) interactions. A repeated-measures laboratory study with 20 participants (24.2Â Â±Â 1.5 years; 10 males) was conducted to compare biomechanical exposures (joint angle, moment, and muscle activity in the neck and shoulder), subjective discomfort, and task performance (speed and accuracy) during two VR tasks (omni-directional pointing and painting tasks) among different vertical target locations (ranged from 15Â° above to 30Â° below eye height). The results showed that neck flexion/extension angle and moment, shoulder flexion angle and moment, shoulder abduction angle, muscle activities of neck and shoulder muscles, and subjective discomfort in the neck and shoulder significantly varied by target locations (p'sÂ <Â 0.001). The target locations at 15Â° above and 30Â° below eye height demonstrated greater shoulder flexion (up to 52Â°), neck flexion moment (up to 2.7Nm), anterior deltoid muscle activity, and subjective discomfort in the neck and shoulder as compared to the other locations. This result indicates that excessive vertical target locations should be avoided to reduce musculoskeletal discomfort and injury risks during VR interactions. Based on relatively lower biomechanical exposures and trade-off between neck and shoulder postures, vertical target location between eye height and 15Â° below eye height could be recommended for VR use.","Virtual environment, Hand gestures, Head-mounted display, Task performance",Sai Akhil Penumudi and Veera Aneesh Kuppam and Jeong Ho Kim and Jaejin Hwang,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019302194,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.103010,0003-6870,2020,103010,84,Applied Ergonomics,"The effects of target location on musculoskeletal load, task performance, and subjective discomfort during virtual reality interactions",article,PENUMUDI2020103010
"This study aimed at determining the extent to which individuals with neck-shoulder pain and non-symptomatic individuals differ in muscle activation patterns, when performing computer work, as quantified by exposure variation analysis (EVA). As a secondary aim, we also aimed to quantify the day-to-day reliability of EVA variables describing trapezius muscle activation in a non-symptomatic control group. Thirteen touch-typing computer users (pain: nâ?¯=â?¯5, non-symptomatic: nâ?¯=â?¯8) completed three pre-selected computer tasks in the laboratory. Upper trapezius muscle activity was recorded using electromyography and analyzed using EVA with five amplitude and five duration categories. Individuals with neck-shoulder pain spent less time at low amplitudes and exhibited longer uninterrupted periods of muscle activation compared to their non-symptomatic counterparts. Thus, non-symptomatic workers tended to switch between exposure levels more often than individuals with pain. For a majority of EVA variables, ICCs ranged from 0.6 to 0.9, and between-days coefficients of variation were between 0.4 and 2.2.","Exposure variation analysis, Motor variability, Reliability",Denean M.

"Objective We assessed the effects of source type bias (human or automation) on adviser trust in a dual adviser decision-making task. Background Source type and reliability's effects on adviser trust have been studied in a dual-adviser context, but the influence of pedigree (perceived expertise) across source types lacked robust investigation. As situations with two decision-aids of uneven pedigree can easily arise, it is critical to understand how operators are biased towards a decision-aid of a certain source type and pedigree. Method A decision-making task similar to the paradigm of Convoy Leader (Lyons and Stokes, 2012) was given to participants, where a military convoy route had to be selected in the presence of IEDs and insurgent activity. We measured behavioral reliance and trust attitudes. Pedigree was manipulated via controlled adviser descriptions, in a manner consistent with past investigations (Madhavan and Wiegmann, 2007a). Results We found a trust bias towards the human adviser, reversed only when there is a far greater pedigree in the automated adviser. Trust attitudes were also strongly indicative of reliance behaviors. Conclusion Pedigree is a strong influencer of trust in a decision-aid and biased towards human advisers. Trust is highly predictive of reliance decisions. Application System designers must take care with how â??expertâ? automation is portrayed, particularly if it is used in conjunction with other human advisers (e.g.: conflicting advice from air-traffic control and an onboard system).","Dual adviser, Decision support system, Reliance, Decision-making, Decision aid, Trust in automation",Carl J.

"In order to detect automation failures in a timely manner, operators are required to monitor automated systems efficiently. The present study analysed eye movements to predict whether or not participants could detect an automation failure. Eye movements were recorded whilst 101 participants were monitoring an automated system where automation failures occurred at irregular intervals. A main result is that about 75.6 per cent of automation failure detections were predicted successfully by the corresponding eye movements. In cases where failures were detected successfully, relevant information is monitored more often and more intensively, in particular shortly before an automation failure happens and while it is happening. The findings are discussed in the context of the personnel selection and training of aviation operatives, as well as incident reporting as used in air traffic control (ATC).","Human monitoring, Automation failures, Failure detection, Personnel selection, Eye tracking, Eye movements",Carmen Bruder and Catrin Hasse,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018305593,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102967,0003-6870,2020,102967,82,Applied Ergonomics,What the eyes reveal: Investigating the detection of automation failures,article,BRUDER2020102967
"The purpose was to evaluate whether a cold-water immersion test could be used to identify individuals susceptible to local cold injuries (LCI). Sixty-five healthy non-injured (Nâ??I) subjects, and fifteen subjects, who were tested either prior to or after a LCI, sequentially immersed one hand and one foot, in 8â?¯Â°C water for 30â?¯min (CWI phase); this was followed by 15â?¯min of spontaneous rewarming (RW phase). The LCI group showed a lower toe temperature during the CWI phase, and a lower maximum RW temperature of the fingers than the Nâ??I group. However, digit temperatures during the CWI and RW phases exhibited low predictive values for LCI, e.g. results implied that to identify 80% of the LCI subjects, 34â??78% of the Nâ??I subjects would also be excluded. Thus, the results suggest that, in practice, hand or foot cold-water immersion tests cannot be used to identify individuals at high risk of LCI.","CIVD, Water immersion, Frostbite",Lena Norrbrand and Roger KÃ¶legÃ¥rd and Michail E.

"Purpose To assess differences in spinal, pelvic and lower limb parameters in healthy individuals during a stand-to-sit task using three different seating conditions. Methods Ten healthy adults carried out three stand-to-sit movements on different stools: a high ergonomic stool with the seat tilted 10Â° forward; a standard stool (adjusted to the same height as the ergonomic stool) and a standard stool at a lower level (so their thighs were horizontal). Movements were recorded by an optoelectronic Vicon system. Results Hip flexion was altered by the height of the seat (significantly greater for the low standard stool in comparison to either the ergonomic stool or the high standard stool (pâ?¯<â?¯0.0001)). There was also significantly less knee flexion with the ergonomic stool in comparison to the low standard stool (pâ?¯<â?¯0.0001) and to the high standard stool (pâ?¯=â?¯0.0017). Lumbar lordosis was not significantly altered by seat height, although it was less pronounced with the ergonomic stool, with a significantly higher range of motion for the pelvis (pâ?¯=â?¯0.015). At the thoracic level, no differences were observed, except that the stand-to-sit movement on the lower stool produced greater flexion. Conclusion Lumbar lordosis was not increased by the ergonomic stool and the range of lower limb motion was reduced by the high seat. These findings contrast with current opinion that ergonomic seats promote lumbar lordosis.","Ergonomic seat, Motion analysis, Lordosis",Emmanuelle ChalÃ©at-Valayer and Camille Samuel and StÃ©phane Verdun and Rachel Bard-PondarrÃ© and Jean-Claude Bernard and GrÃ©goire {Le Blay} and Eric Berthonnaud,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018303983,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.05.001,0003-6870,2019,67--74,80,Applied Ergonomics,Impact of an ergonomic seat on the stand-to-sit strategy in healthy subjects: Spinal and lower limbs kinematics,article,CHALEATVALAYER201967
"Healthcare is increasingly complex and requires the ability to adapt to changing demands. Teamwork is essential to delivering high quality care and is central to nursing. The aims of this study were to identify the processes that underpin nursing teamwork and how these affect the care of older people, identify the relationship between perceived teamwork and perceived quality of care, and explore in depth the experience of working in nursing teams. The study was carried out in three older people's wards in a London teaching hospital. Nurses and healthcare assistants completed questionnaires (nâ?¯=â?¯65) on known dynamics of teamwork (using the Nursing Teamwork Survey) together with ratings of organisational quality (using an adapted AHRQ HSPS scale). A sample (nâ?¯=â?¯22; 34%) was then interviewed about their perceptions of care, teamwork and how good outcomes are delivered in everyday work. Results showed that many care difficulties were routinely encountered, and confirmed the importance of teamwork (e.g. shared mental models of tasks and team roles and responsibilities, supported by leadership) in adapting to challenges. Perceived quality of teamwork was positively related to perceived quality of care. Work system variability and the external environment influenced teamwork, and confirmed the importance of team adaptive capacity. The CARE model shows the centrality of teamwork in adapting to variable demand and capacity to deliver care processes, and the influence of broader system factors on teamworking.","Teamwork, Quality of care, Nursing, Acute care, Care of older people",J.E.

"Background The prolonged standing position is an important factor in the onset of foot musculoskeletal disorders among workers. Safety shoes, designed to protect against the physical constraints of the work environment, do not address this issue to date. Objectives The goal of this study is to assess the possible benefits of custom-made foot orthoses among prolonged standing workers. Study design repeated measures without control group. Methods Thirty-four standing workers who suffer from foot pain volunteered for the study. Custom-made foot orthoses, designed by a podiatrist, were 3D-printed and distributed to each volunteer. Static balance as well as static and dynamic plantar pressure measurements were carried out with sensors inserted in the safety shoes, before and after three weeks of wearing foot orthoses daily. A questionnaire on pain and comfort was also distributed before and after treatment. Results Feelings of pain, discomfort and heavy legs were found to be significantly reduced after wearing 3D-printed orthoses (p<0.05). Additionally, in static and dynamic conditions, a significant decrease in mean peak pressure in the rearfoot area was observed along with a significant increase in mean peak pressure in the midfoot area (p<0.05). There was also a significant improvement of balance in the medial-lateral direction. Conclusion Custom-made orthoses significantly increase the well-being of standing workers in our experimental testing conditions. The custom-made shape allows for a better balanced distribution of foot peak pressure thanks to its support and stimulation of the foot arches particularly through a shift of pressure from the heel to the midfoot.","Foot orthoses, Standing work, Pain",Tristan Tarrade and Fabrice Doucet and Nicolas Saint-LÃ´ and Maxime Llari and Michel Behr,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018302254,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.05.013,0003-6870,2019,130--135,80,Applied Ergonomics,Are custom-made foot orthoses of any interest on the treatment of foot pain for prolonged standing workers?,article,TARRADE2019130
"We investigated the learning of fine manual dexterity with a microsurgical instrument and a new simulator in a context of microsurgery. 30 subjects were divided into two groups. One (3D group) interacted with a stereoscopic and the other (2D group) with a monoscopic display. Visual information for the displays was captured from a surgical stereomicroscope. In 20 trials, both groups performed the repetitive tasks of picking up small rods from a funnel-shaped cavity and placing them outside. In analysing learning curves, we found that the initial learning process for hand-eye coordination is easier with a 3D display, and that performance persists at a higher level of proficiency than with the 2D display option. Thus stereoscopic displays can be especially beneficial for novices, for those learning new procedures, or for providing orientation to operators facing a new or altered spatial situation. Simulators with few reliefs or spatial textures should not be used for comparison between 3D and 2D viewing conditions.","Microsurgery, Stereoscopy, Skill acquisition",Franka Wehr and JÃ¼rgen Held,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300201,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.01.006,0003-6870,2019,40--49,77,Applied Ergonomics,Stereoscopic versus monoscopic displays: Learning fine manual dexterity skills using a microsurgical task simulator,article,WEHR201940
"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficiency of a specific ambulance while providers delivered basic and advanced life support. Forty-eight, Emergency Medical Service (EMS) teams were observed delivering care to a simulated patient during an anaphylaxis scenario in a moving ambulance that contained a complete compliment of medical supplies and equipment. A detailed coding system was developed and applied to the audio and video behavioural data. Patterns of interaction among EMS personnel, the patient, equipment and the ambulance interior during the patient simulation scenario were analyzed. The results revealed a number of issues associated with the patient compartment including: potentially unsafe seated and standing positions; hazardous barriers to movement around the patient; difficulties accessing equipment and supplies; and the adequacy of work surfaces and waste disposal.

"Applied ergonomics research examines not only the fit, form and function of military uniforms, but also their ability to effectively camouflage personnel as they perform job-related tasks. Many of these job-related tasks involve moving through environments, but existing literature examining camouflage effectiveness often assumes that movement effectively â??breaksâ? even the best camouflage patterns, rendering them of limited utility for reducing the visual signature of a moving target. However, recent research demonstrates that animals equipped with adaptive camouflage change their patterning in predictable ways during movement and this adaptation decreases detectability, suggesting that uniform patterning may still hold value for reducing conspicuity during movement. The present experiment examined whether three visual pattern characteristics, local contrast, orientation, and spatial frequency, would influence the detectability of a moving human target. Participants attempted to detect and localize a simulated human target moving across a background scene, and a factorial design varied target movement speed, and the local contrast, spatial frequency, and orientation of its camouflage patterning. Results showed that target detectability was strongly influenced by target movement rate, pattern local contrast, and pattern spatial frequency, and these effects persisted even under conditions of very fast movement. Importantly, we found that the effect of local contrast was most robust under conditions of movement, suggesting its importance for reducing detectability of moving personnel. We conclude that movement is not always sufficient to break the concealment offered by a pattern with low contrast and a spatial frequency match with its background. Results are discussed in the context of visual processing theories and the application of these findings to the design and development of static and adaptive camouflage patterns for military personnel.","Camouflage, Visual salience, Pattern features, Visual perception",Tad T.

"Purpose This paper outlines an approach to develop practical guidelines to support the design of submarine control console workstations. Method Guideline development was undertaken for 13 physical design criteria, provided to the research team. Data was gathered from four sources: a systematic literature review, relevant standards, population specific anthropometric data, and user focus groups. The systematic review included risk of bias, quality assessment and evidence synthesis. Results & Conclusion The systematic review retrieved 43 relevant articles in relation to seven of the 13 design criteria. Very few high-quality studies were identified. The combined evidence available from each of the four data sources was collated and used to provide a set of guidelines for each of the 13 criteria, highlighting the importance of the use of multiple data sources. This approach has applicability beyond this study where the need exists to collate evidence sources beyond the scientific literature.","Guidelines, Workstation, Musculoskeletal disorders, Submarines, Systematic review",Jodi Oakman and Rwth Stuckey and Natasha Kinsman,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018306331,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.04.006,0003-6870,2019,54--65,79,Applied Ergonomics,Using evidence to support the design of submarine control console workstations,article,OAKMAN201954
The purpose of this study was to quantify biomechanical and cardiovascular exposure while making beds with and without interventions (mattress lift tool and fitted sheet). Sixteen female hotel room cleaners participated in this multifactorial (tool and sheet) laboratory study of crossover design. Exertion in the upper extremity (<2) and back (<3) was consistently lower when using the tool and fitted sheet (pâ?¯<â?¯0.05). The average number of lifts per bed was reduced by 48% with an 18â?¯s increase in cycle time per bed. Peak forearm flexor activity was significantly lower when using a tool(pâ?¯<â?¯0.05). Spinal lateral plane range of motion (pâ?¯<â?¯0.02) and maximum twisting velocity (pâ?¯<â?¯0.03) were lowest using the tool and fitted sheet together. Interventions such as a mattress lift tool used with a fitted sheet reduced the number of mattress lifts and lowered perceived exertion among hotel room cleaners while making beds.,"Hotel room cleaners, Bed making, Physical exposure, Biomechanical exposure, Intervention",Carisa Harris-Adamson and Emma Lam and Fadi Fathallah and Angela D.

"Safety is a constant priority for the railway industry and there are numerous hazards in and around the rail system which may result in damage to train and environment, human injury and fatalities. Low levels of human and organisational performance have been shown to be a prime cause of railway accidents and a number of accident models and methods have been developed in order to probe deeper into the role played by organisational factors in accident causation. The Systemsâ??Theoretical Accident Modelling and Processes (STAMP) method for example, represents a promising systematic and systemic way of examining sociotechnical systems such as the railway. Another method, the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS), based upon Reason's model of human error in an organisational context, has also proved popular as a human factors accident analysis framework. However, human factors elements are still somewhat limited and under-specified and these managerial and social issues within an organisation are simply regarded as sources of failure in the control constraints of STAMP. HFACS likewise, categorises accident data rather than analysing it in more depth. In this context, a hybrid human and organisational analysis method based on HFACS-STAMP (HFACS-STAMP method for railway accidents, HS-RAs) is proposed to identify and analyse human and organisational factors involved in railway accidents. Using the categories of human errors derived from HFACS and the structured systematic analysis process of STAMP, the HS-RAs method provides a mechanism by which active failures can promulgate across organisations and give a systemic analysis of human error in accidents. Combined with human information processing, the HS-RAs method gives a detailed causal analysis of human errors from receiving information to implement control actions. At last, the HS-RAs method is demonstrated using a case study of the 2011 Yong-Wen railway collision. A number of prominent accident causes of human factors are revealed and necessary countermeasures are proposed to avoid the recurrence of similar accidents. The HFACS-STAMP hybrid method has several advantages and can contribute to railway safety by providing a detailed analysis of the role of human error in railway accidents.","Human and organisational factors, STAMP, HFACS, Human information processing, Accident analysis, Yong-Wen railway accident",Chenling Li and Tao Tang and Maria Mikela Chatzimichailidou and Gyuchan Thomas Jun and Patrick Waterson,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018307427,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.12.011,0003-6870,2019,122--142,79,Applied Ergonomics,A hybrid human and organisational analysis method for railway accidents based on STAMP-HFACS and human information processing,article,LI2019122
"Shoe wear is known to increase slipping risk, but few studies have systematically studied this relationship. This study investigated the impact of progressive shoe wear on the available coefficient of friction (ACOF) and under-shoe fluid dynamics. Five different slip-resistant shoes were progressively worn using an accelerated, abrasive, wear protocol. The ACOF and fluid forces (the load supported by the fluid) were measured as shoes were slipped across a surface contaminated with a diluted glycerol solution. As the shoes became worn, an initial increase in ACOF was followed by a steady decrease. Low fluid forces were observed prior to wear followed by increased fluid forces as the worn region became larger. Results suggest that traction performance decreases particularly when the heel region without tread exceeds a size of 800â?¯mm2. This study supports the concept of developing shoe replacement guidelines based upon the size of the worn region to reduce occupational slips.","Biomechanics, Slips and falls, Available coefficient of friction",Sarah L.

"In hospitals, clinicians often need to monitor several patients while performing other tasks. However, visual displays that show patients' vital signs are in fixed locations and auditory alarms intended to alert clinicians may be missed. Information such as spearcons (time-compressed speech earcons) that â??travelsâ?? with the clinician and is delivered by earpiece and/or head-worn displays (HWDs), might overcome these problems. In this study, non-clinicians monitored five simulated patients in three 10-min scenarios while performing a demanding tracking task. Monitoring accuracy was better for participants using spearcons and a HWD (88.7%) or a HWD alone (86.2%) than for participants using spearcons alone (74.1%). Participants using the spearcons and HWD (37.7%) performed the tracking task no differently from participants using spearcons alone (37.1%) but participants using the HWD alone performed worse overall (33.1%). The combination of both displays may be a suitable solution for monitoring multiple patients.","Alarm fatigue, Auditory display, Head-worn display, Smartglasses",Sara Klueber and Erik Wolf and Tobias Grundgeiger and Birgit Brecknell and Ismail Mohamed and Penelope Sanderson,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300158,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.01.009,0003-6870,2019,86--96,78,Applied Ergonomics,Supporting multiple patient monitoring with head-worn displays and spearcons,article,KLUEBER201986
"This study investigated the effects with training and graphical icons on task performance for elderly novice users on automatic teller machines (ATMs). 124 elderly novice users who had no prior ATM experience participated in the training and test of ATM usage. Participants in the control group (nâ?¯=â?¯62) were training to use the traditional text-based ATM interface meanwhile those in the experimental group (nâ?¯=â?¯62) were training to use the alternative ATM interface with graphical icons. They were asked to learn how to perform three major tasks of ATMs. A test immediately following the training and a test one month after training was carried out. Task completion score was used for measuring user performance. The results showed although training could help elderly novice users succeed in learning to use ATMs, they still had a significant decline in user performance in the test one month later compared with the immediate test. Participants of the experimental group outperformed those of the control group in both the immediate test and one month test after training, especially in the latter. The finding suggested graphical icons could help to improve the learning and retention of ATM usage for elderly novice users, especially the latter, which would compensate for the drawback of training and reduce forgetting rate to some extent. Well-designed graphical icons could benefit elderly novice users much from learning phase to retention phase. The findings of this study can be applied to guide the design and development of ATMs or other public technology devices considering elderly novice users.","Training, Graphical icons, User performance, Elderly novice users, ATMs",He Huang and Minggang Yang and Chaoxiang Yang and Taifeng Lv,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300432,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.02.006,0003-6870,2019,62--69,78,Applied Ergonomics,User performance effects with graphical icons and training for elderly novice users: A case study on automatic teller machines,article,HUANG201962
"Active computer workstations may help reduce workplace sedentarism. However, their impact on the upper limb musculoskeletal system is unknown. Subjects participated in two 60-min computer laptop-based Bike-and-Type sessions at different cycling intensities (LOW, HIGH). Upper trapezius and wrist extensor muscle blood flow, sensitivity and pain thresholds, and typing performance were measured intermittently. Neck/shoulder discomfort increased over time (pâ?¯<â?¯0.001), and was higher in the HIGH intensity (pâ?¯=â?¯0.036). Blood flow to the trapezius (pâ?¯=â?¯0.041) and wrist (pâ?¯=â?¯0.021) muscles were higher during HIGH, and wrist blood flow increased over time (pâ?¯=â?¯0.01). Trapezius sensitivity threshold significantly decreased over time (pâ?¯=â?¯0.003). There were no effects on pressure pain thresholds (interaction pâ?¯=â?¯0.091). Average typing speed was greater during HIGH (pâ?¯=â?¯0.046) and increased over time (pâ?¯<â?¯0.001).

"Roadside advertising signs are a salient potential source of driver's distraction. Previous research has mainly investigated driver's visual attention to billboards, which represents only one category of advertising signs. In this study, driver's visual attention was assessed in a naturalistic driving setting for six categories of roadside advertising signs: vendor signs, billboards, movable display boards, single and multiple commercial directional signs, and gas price LED displays. Fixation rate, fixation duration, fixation distance and driving speed were assessed in a sample of 15 drivers along a 30-km route including a total of 154 advertising signs belonging to the six categories described above. The role of clearance from the road, elevation, height, width, surface, number and size of characters, total number of characters, side of the road (driving side, opposite side), context (rural, urban), were also considered. Overall 24% of the roadside advertising signs were fixated. Fixation rate was significantly influenced by sign category, clearance from the road and number of characters. Median value for fixation duration was 297â?¯ms. Fixation duration was significantly influenced by speed, elevation from road level, number of medium size characters, and was higher in the rural context. Median value for fixation distance was 58.10â?¯m, and was significantly influenced by advertising sign category, character count and speed.","Roadside advertising signs, Eye movements, Distraction, Fixation duration, Fixation distance",Marco Costa and Leonardo Bonetti and Valeria Vignali and Arianna Bichicchi and Claudio Lantieri and Andrea Simone,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300559,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.03.001,0003-6870,2019,127--136,78,Applied Ergonomics,Driver's visual attention to different categories of roadside advertising signs,article,COSTA2019127
"Background Sixty-four to 90% of computer users experience symptoms of computer vision syndrome (CVS). People with CVS symptoms experience neck pain (NP), and people with NP can have visual symptoms. Objectives (1) To examine differences in CVS symptoms in computer users with and without persistent NP. (2) To determine relationships between visual ergonomics, demographics, and CVS in those with and without persistent NP Design Comparative cross-sectional observational study Method An online survey consisting of multiple questionnaires including the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire (CVS-Q), Visual Symptoms Survey (VSS), and Convergence Insufficiency Symptoms Survey (CISS) was completed by 167 participants. Results The persistent NP group had significantly higher CVS-Q, VSS, and CISS scores (p <0.01) compared to controls. No relationships were found between visual ergonomics, demographics, and visual symptoms in both groups. Conclusions People with persitent NP are more likely to present with CVS than controls.

"The aim of this study was to propose a new method for optimizing the touch-screen installation position in order to minimize the physical workload and increase screen visibility. Ten students participated in this study. The participants utilized a touch screen at different installation heights (50, 65, and 80% of stature), tilt angles (0Â°, 45Â°, and 90Â° from the horizontal plane), and having different button sizes (a square with a side of 10, 20, and 30â?¯mm). The joint angles, when using a touch screen, were measured to calculate the joint torque ratios (JTRs). Subjective screen visibility were also determined. The optimal installation position was determined by solving a bi-objective optimization problem consisting of two objective functions. The Pareto optimal solutions for the two objectives showed a range of 1124â??1251â?¯mm and 44.4â??67.9Â°. The proposed method determined the optimal installation position of the touch screens.","Multi-objective optimization, Digital human modeling, Touch screen, Physical workload, Joint torque, Visibility",Takanori Chihara and Akihiko Seo and Jiro Sakamoto,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018305891,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102881,0003-6870,2019,102881,81,Applied Ergonomics,A novel approach to bi-objective optimization of touch-screen installation position for minimizing physical workload and increasing screen visibility,article,CHIHARA2019102881
"Inattention can be considered a primary cause of vehicular accidents or crashes, and in-car warning signals are applied to alert the driver to take action even in automated vehicles. Because of age related decline of the older driver's abilities, in-car warning signals may need adjustment to the older driver. We therefore investigated the effects of uni-, bi- and trimodal directional warnings (i.e., light, sound, vibration) on young and older drivers' responses in a driving simulator. A young group of 15 drivers (20â??25 years of age) and an older group of 16 drivers (65â??79 years of age) participated. In the simulations, warning signal was presented at the left, the center, or the right in front of the participant. With a warning at the left, the center, and the right the correct response was to steer to the right, brake, and steer to the left, respectively. The main results showed the older drivers' responses were slower for each type of warning compared with the young drivers' responses. Overall, the responses were slower with an added cognitively loading task. The only multimodal type of warning inducing overall faster response than its constituent warning types was the vibration-sound, and only for the older drivers. Additionally, with the groups' responses collapsed, such a true multimodal effect on response time also showed for the center vibration-sound warning (i.e., braking response). The only multimodal warning showing clear reduction in response errors compared with its constituent warning types was the vibration-sound for the older drivers during extra cognitive load. The main conclusion is that older drivers can benefit from bimodal warning, as compared with unimodal, in terms of faster and more accurate response. The potential superiority of trimodal warning is nevertheless argued.","Multimodal, Multisensory, Bimodal, Trimodal, In-car warning",Linda-Marie Lundqvist and Lars Eriksson,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701930002X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.01.002,0003-6870,2019,147--154,76,Applied Ergonomics,"Age, cognitive load, and multimodal effects on driver response to directional warning",article,LUNDQVIST2019147
"Automated vehicles (AV's) offer greater flexibility in cabin design particularly in a future where no physical driving controls are required. One common concept for an automated vehicle is to have both forward and rearward facing seats. However, traveling backwards could lead to an increased likelihood of experiencing motion sickness due to the inability of occupants to anticipate the future motion trajectory. This study aimed to empirically evaluate the impact of seating orientation on the levels of motion sickness within an AV cabin. To this end, a vehicle was modified to replicate the common concept of automated vehicles with forward and rearward facing seats. Two routes were chosen to simulate motorway and urban driving. The participants were instructed to carry out typical office tasks whilst being driven in the vehicle which consisted of conducting a meeting, operating a personal device and taking notes. The participants conducted the test twice to experience both forward and rearward seating orientations in a randomised crossover design. Levels of sickness reported was relatively low with a significant increase in the mean level of sickness recorded when traveling rearwards. As expected, this increase was particularly pronounced under urban driving conditions. It is concluded that rearward travel in automated vehicles will compromise the passenger experience.","Automated vehicle, Motion sickness, Seating orientation",Spencer Salter and Cyriel Diels and Paul Herriotts and Stratis Kanarachos and Doug Thake,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701830629X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.02.001,0003-6870,2019,54--61,78,Applied Ergonomics,Motion sickness in automated vehicles with forward and rearward facing seating orientations,article,SALTER201954
"The Visual Field (VF) principle has been found to apply in many situations, but has not been tested under many possible conditions of operator posture with different display and control locations. In this research we used four display locations, four control locations relative to a seated operator and tested the strength of population stereotype for six different types of controls with linear displays moving either horizontally or vertically and circular displays with a neutral indicator at the 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. Apart from several minor differences in operator responses, the VF principle held up well under all these different display/control relationships. By designing the display/control arrangement to have high stereotype strength, the direction of control movement for a given direction of indicator movement can be selected to comply with the VF principle for producing fewest errors in movement direction.","Visual field principle, Control/display stereotypes, Operator location",Errol R.

"The relationship of Web design attributes (personalisation, structure, navigation, layout, search and performance) and users' personal characteristics to website usability and user satisfaction was investigated among 798 online banking users in Iran. The design and usability of the evaluated websites were not satisfactory from the usersâ?? perspectives. Multivariate regression models indicated that Web layout and performance were the main predictors of website usability, while personal characteristics including gender, age and Web usage experience of users had no effect. User satisfaction was also influenced only by the Web design attributes (particularly Web structure) and not by the personal characteristics of the users. There was also a significant relationship between website usability and user satisfaction. The findings suggest that the website designers should focus more on the Web design attributes (particularly Web layout and structure), regardless of the personal characteristics of their users, to improve the usability and user satisfaction of websites.","E-banking, E-satisfaction, Internet banking, Web site",Iman Dianat and Pari Adeli and Mohammad {Asgari Jafarabadi} and Mohammad Ali Karimi,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301243,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102892,0003-6870,2019,102892,81,Applied Ergonomics,"User-centred web design, usability and user satisfaction: The case of online banking websites in Iran",article,DIANAT2019102892
"The use of riding lawn equipment (RLE) is related to a significant number of accidents every year. To provide basis for product design and enhance user performance and safety, a usability and performance assessment of modern riding lawn-mowing tractor designs and features was conducted in a real-world test environment. Five current commercially available RLEs were tested with response measures including task performance time and accuracy, physiological workload, system usability scores (SUS), and subjective rankings of RLE models. This data was used to identify sensitivity of responses to variations in RLE design features and functionality. The data was also used to assess the validity of new tractor design standard conformance tool, the RLEval methodology. This tool made comprehensive evaluation of RLE models compliance with over 70 specific design standards and was applied by human factors experts. Experiment results revealed sensitivity of all response measures to design differences among the five RLE models, except the objective workload measures. Response measures including task performance, SUSs and subjective rankings showed partial agreement with the RLEval scores. In general, the study results demonstrated a comprehensive experimental methodology for usability and performance evaluations of RLEs as well as merit of using the RLEval as preliminary method to compare design features. Some aspects of the usability experimentation and the RLEval method appear to be complementary.","Riding lawn-mowing equipment, Standards compliance, Usability assessment, Human factors, Safety",Yulin Deng and James Shirley and Tyler Rose and Laura Geary and David Feltner and Karen Chen and Jeffery Hoyle and Mohini Dutt and David B.

WARD use improved operator trackkeeping performance, the practice of good seamanship, and SA, although operator responsiveness decreased. WARD users who used more closed-loop communication and information sharing showed improved threat avoidance, suggesting that operators can avoid accidents and failure through WARD use that promotes sharing and confirming information.

"We studied the effects of task load variations as a function of flight complexity on combat pilots' gaze behavior (i.e., entropy) while solving in-flight emergencies. The second company of the Spanish Army Attack Helicopter Battalion (nâ?¯=â?¯15) performed three sets of standardized flight exercises with different levels of complexity (low [recognition flights], medium and high [emergency flights]). Throughout the flight exercises we recorded pilots' gaze entropy, as well as pilots' performance (assessed by an expert flight instructor) and subjective ratings of task load (assessed by the NASA-Task Load Index). Furthermore, we used pilots' electroencephalographic (EEG) activity as a reference physiological index for task load variations. We found that pilotsâ?? gaze entropy decreased â?¼2% (i.e., visual scanning became less erratic) while solving the emergency flight exercises, showing a significant decreasing trend with increasing complexity (pâ?¯<â?¯.05). This is in consonance with the â?¼12% increase in the frontal theta band of their EEG spectra during said exercises. Pilots' errors and subjective ratings of task load increased as flight complexity increased (p-valuesâ?¯<â?¯.05). Gaze data suggest that pilots used nondeterministic visual patterns when the aircraft was in an error-free state (low complexity), and changed their scanning behavior, becoming more deterministic, once emergencies occurred (medium/high complexity). Overall, our findings indicate that gaze entropy can serve as a sensitive index of task load in aviation settings.","Brain activity, Cognition, EEG, Eye movements, Eye tracking, Flight",Carolina Diaz-Piedra and Hector Rieiro and Alberto Cherino and Luis J.

"Background There is a high rate of injury associated with firefighting: in 2016, 21% of all fireground injuries were attributed to falls, jumps and slips. Examining factors related to balance, including experience in wearing firefighter gear, may assist in reducing injury related to falls. Objectives To assess the effects of wearing firefighter gear on postural balance in firefighters and non-firefighters in a rested condition. Methods Each subject attended two sessions. In session 1, informed consent was obtained, a threshold audiogram was collected, and the sensory organization test (SOT) and motor control test (MCT) were administered with the subject dressed in street clothes. The second session was comprised of three different conditions with the order of testing randomized across subjects: street clothing, firefighter protective garments (coat, pants, helmet, hood) with breathing apparatus but no facemask, and firefighter protective garments with breathing apparatus and facemask. Twenty subjects participated: ten firefighters (8 males) and sex and age-matched non-firefighters (8 males) completed the study. Results SOT scores were obtained for each sub-condition, including the overall performance score and sensory weightings. For the MCT, latency and amplitude data were obtained for the three forward and three reverse translation conditions. A significant difference was found for large forward surface translations in the MCT in firefighters. Conclusion In spite of the altered center of balance created by breathing apparatus and the altered visual cues created by the facemask, wearing firefighter gear did not substantively affect anterior-posterior postural stability or motor response to linear translation in rested, healthy individuals. Firefighters and non-firefighters performed similarly across all except one of the experimental conditions.","Posturography, Firefighters, Thermal protective clothing, SCBA",Deanna Colburn and Lindsey Russo and Robert Burkard and David Hostler,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300948,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.05.010,0003-6870,2019,187--192,80,Applied Ergonomics,"Firefighter protective clothing and self contained breathing apparatus does not alter balance testing using a standard sensory organization test or motor control test in healthy, rested individuals",article,COLBURN2019187
"Diabetes can undermine people's ability to drive safely, but most previous studies have focused on its deterioration of the central nervous system. This study sought to investigate how diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a common complication of diabetes characterized by reduced sensitivity of the limbs, can influence people's braking behavior and other safety-related measures of driving. In addition, it also tested how such a deteriorating effect can be reduced by using certain pedal layout designs. In total, 29 healthy drivers and 31 drivers of type 2 diabetes matched in demographic variables were invited to participate in this study. The participants with type 2 diabetes (they are from here on out referred to as â??patients"")were then split into two subgroups based on the severity of DPN using the median of the Semmesâ??Weinstein monofilaments Examination (SWME) scores. All three groups of participants finished a series of vehicle-pedestrian conflict tasks in a driving simulator using nine different types of pedal layouts. These layouts varied in the lateral distance between the accelerator and the brake (45â?¯mm, 60â?¯mm, and 75â?¯mm) and the width of brake pedals (50â?¯mm, 70â?¯mm, 90â?¯mm). The results showed that patients with serious DPN had longer brake reaction times (BRT) and shorter minimum distance-to-collision (DTC) as compared to the other two groups. However, the effects of such a disadvantage varied across different pedal layouts. When the accelerator-brake distance was 45â?¯mm, patients with serious DPN showed no compromised driving performance as compared to other two groups. In conclusion, we found the DPN could undermine driving performance of participants with type 2 diabetes, and a closer accelerator-brake lateral distance (45â?¯mm) may be an optimal choice for them to counteract such a negative influence.","Drivers with type 2 diabetes, Braking behavior, Diabetic peripheral neuropathy, Pedal layout design",Shu Ma and Changxu Wu and Jingyu Zhang and Xianzhong Zeng and Guozhen Zhao and Xianghong Sun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701930081X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.04.015,0003-6870,2019,43--49,80,Applied Ergonomics,Looking for an optimal pedal layout to improve the driving performance of patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy,article,MA201943

Phase II describes a formal evaluation study, involving simulated procedures with a patient mannequin and active service paramedics in a real ambulance. Results indicated subjective preferences for the new bags, where 62% of the paramedics believed it was easier to find equipment in the new bag and 65% preferred the new bags overall.

"The current study examined the effects of display curvature and hand length on various smartphone usability measures. In total, 20 young participants completed reading, image viewing, video watching, calling, and texting using four smartphone devices with distinct display curvatures. Diverse usability measures related to these tasks were obtained. The four curvatures (flat, horizontally convex, vertically concave, and horizontally concave) each demonstrated both beneficial and detrimental effects; however, hand size effects were non-significant across all usability measures. No single fixed display curvature was found to be beneficial across all considered smartphone usability measures, indicating multiple curvatures (e.g. combinations of flat and vertically concave curvatures) are required from a single smartphone model rather than a single fixed curvature to improve an overall smartphone usability. Such varying curvatures are feasible with bendable displays. Comprehensive usability evaluations, especially focusing on grip comfort and image distortion, are needed when applying display curvatures on small devices.","Smartphone usability, Typing, Eye discomfort, Presence, Image distortion, Grip comfort",Jihhyeon Yi and Sungryul Park and Gyouhyung Kyung,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300389,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.02.002,0003-6870,2019,13--25,78,Applied Ergonomics,Ambivalent effects of display curvature on smartphone usability,article,YI201913
"For improved prevention of health issues among blue-collar workers, there is a need for an overview of the physical activity at work and leisure using technical long-term measurements in blue-collar sectors investigation of differences between the sectors. Thus, the objective of this paper was to provide an overview and investigate differences in physical activities and body postures at work and leisure among blue-collar sectors. The Dphacto cohort consists of 1087 workers from manufacturing, transportation and cleaning sectors (901 blue-collar and 186 white-collar workers) in Denmark. Eligible workers provided physical activity and heart rate measurements over several days with follow-up on health-related outcomes by self-report and registers. Considerable differences in sitting, standing, time on feet (walking, shuffling and standing combined) and forward bending of the back were found between work and leisure, and between the sectors. This overview of physical activity at work and leisure can be useful for better prevention of work-related health issues among blue-collar workers.","Musculoskeletal pain, Work environment, Occupational health, Physical workload, Physical work demand, Heart rate, Heart rate reserve, Electrocardiography, Body posture, Actiheart, Actigraph",Marie Birk JÃ¸rgensen and Nidhi Gupta and Mette KorshÃ¸j and Julie Lagersted-Olsen and Morten Villumsen and Ole Steen Mortensen and JÃ¸rgen Skotte and Karen SÃ¸gaard and Pascal Madeleine and Afshin Samani and Anders Ã?rberg and Charlotte Lund Rasmussen and Andreas Holtermann,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300146,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.01.003,0003-6870,2019,29--39,77,Applied Ergonomics,The DPhacto cohort: An overview of technically measured physical activity at work and leisure in blue-collar sectors for practitioners and researchers,article,JORGENSEN201929
"The use of a school trolley is reaching and even surpassing the use of backpacks in many countries, although a recommended load has not been studied. To accomplish this, 3D gait kinematics of the lower limbs and thorax were analysed in 49 students walking unloaded, pulling a school trolley or carrying a backpack, all with either 10%, 15%, or 20% BW. The variables obtained were the degrees of flexion/extension, adduction/abduction and internal/external rotation of the thorax, pelvis, hip, knee and ankle. Statistical parametric mapping was used to evaluate differences between conditions and loads throughout the gait cycle. In the backpack conditions, the magnitudes of the differences decreased from proximal to distal joints compared to the unloaded condition. The use of a school trolley only required minor kinematic adaptations. Therefore, from kinematic analysis, it is recommended to avoid loads above 10% BW for children using a backpack and below 20% BW for children using a trolley.","SPM, Students, Rucksack, Wheeled backpack, Recommendations",E.

"The current study illustrates the icon design process for 20 functions for a smart living room and smart bathroom of a commercial smart building control system. For each function name, seven icon formats (image-related, concept-related, semi-abstract, arbitrary, word, abbreviation, and combined) were developed by 30 graduate students and compared with a preference ranking test by another 13 executive MBA students. The results indicated that the combined, image-related, concept-related, semi-abstract, word, and abbreviation each had nine, four, three, two, one and one function names ranked as the most preferred format, respectively. Since all the design formats except the arbitrary format were ranked as the most preferred at least once, it is worthwhile to generate seven icon formats for a given function and chose the most preferred based on the ranking test result. The participatory design and ranking test evaluation approach can be applied for the design and evaluation of visual icons in other application contexts.","Participatory design, Function-to-object relationship, Icon taxonomy",Chia-Fen Chi and Ratna Sari Dewi and Priska Samali and Dong-Yu Hsieh,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301231,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102891,0003-6870,2019,102891,81,Applied Ergonomics,Preference ranking test for different icon design formats for smart living room and bathroom functions,article,CHI2019102891
"Infrared thermography, thanks to technological developments and lowering prices, is now getting considerable attention as a potential arousal monitor in the safety industry. Nasal skin temperature might be a valid index to track physiological variations due to reduced arousal levels, and its use could prevent a drowsiness-related deterioration of performance. However, the few studies that have investigated nasal skin temperature in applied settings have had inconsistent results. Here, we assessed the validity of nasal skin temperature to monitor changes in arousal levels (from alertness to drowsiness). The participants performed a 2-h simulated driving task while we simultaneously recorded their nasal skin temperature, brain activity (we used frontal delta electroencephalographic [EEG] activity as the reference index of alertness), and driving performance (speeding time). For those variables, we calculated growth curve models. We also collected subjective ratings of alertness and fatigue before and after the driving session. We found that the nasal skin temperature showed a cubic trajectory (it increased for the first 75â?¯min, and then it began to decrease, but such deceleration gradually diminished over time). As expected, frontal delta EEG activity showed an inverted U-shaped quadratic trend (EEG power increased for the first hour and half, and gradually decreased during the last thirty minutes). The speeding time exhibited a similar pattern of change. Subjective sleepiness and fatigue increased after the task. Overall, our results suggest that nasal skin temperature seems to be a valid measure of arousal variations while performing a complex and dynamic everyday task.","Driving simulation, Drowsiness, Electroencephalography, Fatigue detector, Sleepiness",Carolina Diaz-Piedra and Emilo Gomez-Milan and Leandro L. {Di Stasi},https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018306355,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.06.001,0003-6870,2019,102870,81,Applied Ergonomics,Nasal skin temperature reveals changes in arousal levels due to time on task: An experimental thermal infrared imaging study,article,DIAZPIEDRA2019102870
"The purpose of this study is to research if a headrest benefits the comfort of the passenger and lowers muscle activity in the neck when sitting in a reclined (slouched) posture while watching in flight entertainment (IFE) in an aircraft business class seat. No significant differences in muscle activity in the musculus sternocleidomastoid and musculus trapezius pars descendant were found between the conditions with headrest and without headrest. A significant difference in expected comfort rating was found. Subjects indicated they expect to experience more comfort with a headrest when watching IFE for a duration of two movies during a long-haul flight. This study also found a significant difference in posture. In the condition without headrest the head was more upright compared to the condition with headrest. The lack of significant difference in muscle activity and the significant difference in posture may indicate that humans tend to look for a head position that is neutral, in the sense of minimal muscle effort. This study shows that the use of a headrest may benefit the comfort experience of the passenger during flight. However, further research is necessary on the design of the headrest and the long-term effects of head support on comfort, discomfort, muscle activity and fatigue for watching IFE in a slouched posture.","EMG, Posture, Neck angle, Aircraft seat, Headrest, Comfort, TV",M.

"The manner in which control rooms are configured can impact the flow of information between command teams. Previous research revealed bottlenecks of communications between the Sonar Controller (SOC) and the Operations Officer (OPSO) in submarine control rooms. One way to relieve such bottlenecks is to co-locate operators reliant on one another for task relevant information. The aim of the current studies was to use multiple command teams to empirically examine a novel submarine control room configuration and a reduced crew size in comparison to a baseline of contemporary operations to see if such bottlenecks could be removed. Ten teams performed high and low demand Dived Tracking (DT) scenarios in a simulated submarine control room. Activities and communications of the teams were recorded and quantified using the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST) method affording statistical comparisons with a baseline condition of contemporary operations. The findings showed that the co-location of operators relieved the bottleneck of communications between the SOC and the OPSO. Although overall communications increased, this was more balanced across the team and was more adaptive to scenario demand. This was coupled with a significant increase in task completion, even with a reduced crew size, suggesting greater efficiency and productivity. Future research should seek to validate the changes observed with objective measures of task performance.","Submarine, Team work, Communications, Networks",Aaron P.J. Roberts and Neville A.

"Smartphones have become a common tool of daily communication, and a number of text input methods are extensively used. Qwerty and T9 are two universally used smartphone input methods that differ in user experience (UX) when entering phrases with different complexity. Phrase complexity is an indication of the number and type of characters used in a phrase. This study evaluated the impact of both experience and phrase complexity on the UX of Qwerty and T9. Thirty-two participants with different experience levels (high and low) used both Qwerty or T9 to input 40 phrases (both simple and complex phrases). Input time, speed, error rate, galvanic skin response, heart rate, and perceived usability were analyzed as dependent variables. The results indicated that Qwerty was more effective than T9 for entering complex phrases, while no obvious difference was found for simple phrases. Experience had a positive impact on the input method, and Qwerty was more helpful for participants with low experience level. Performance, physiological reaction, and perceived usability data showed similar results. These findings aid the optimal design of text input systems for smartphones.","Smartphone, Input method, Phrase complexity, User experience, Performance",Ying Li and Fangzhou You and Xuqun You and Ming Ji,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018306756,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.05.019,0003-6870,2019,200--208,80,Applied Ergonomics,"Smartphone text input: Effects of experience and phrase complexity on user performance, physiological reaction, and perceived usability",article,LI2019200

"The ability of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) systems to mimic the real world has made it possible to use this technology to create environments for remote collaborative work. This study aimed to understand the feasibility of immersive virtual reality when conducting a collaborative Information Architecture (IA) design task-card sorting, with geographically dispersed participants. Using a between-subjects experimental design, thirty groups of two individuals each completed a card sorting activity using conventional in-person, video screen-sharing method or immersive virtual reality methods. The dependent measures included total time, percentage match with master card set, usability, presence and perceived workload. Overall usability was found to be significantly higher for the immersive virtual reality condition when compared to conventional in-person card sorting. In addition, the new immersive virtual reality technology performed as well as the other two conditions for other dependent variables. Qualitative data from the participants also indicated a positive reaction to the use of immersive virtual reality for this task. Overall, the participants felt they were productive and enjoyed the IVR condition, indicating the potential of IVR-based approaches as an alternative to conventional approaches for IA design.","Computer-supported collaborative work, Virtual reality, Immersive systems, Information architecture design, Card sorting",Shraddhaa Narasimha and Emma Dixon and Jeffrey W.

"The aim of this research was to study the relationship between user sustainable design attitudes versus behaviour, and to develop and test environmental personas as design tools. Current approaches towards environmentally sustainable design are primarily focused on capturing the environmentally conscious and pro-environmental consumers, or changing the attitude and behaviour of the anti-environmental consumer. In a survey of 521 consumers, environmental attitude was a poor predictor of environmental behaviour. A series of interviews was performed with different profiles of environmentally orientated users to assess their environmental attitudes and behaviour. The survey and interview data were used to develop four personas, one for each of the environmental attitude and behaviour types based on data from the consumer survey. A case study performed with university design students found that concepts generated by groups using environmentally orientated personas scored higher on environmental sustainability versus those generated by groups using an image board. This study illustrates how user-centred design approaches could be used to embed sustainable design in products by exploiting consumer environmental behaviour to overcome different attitudes and behaviour.","User centred design, Personas, Sustainability, Design, Environmental",Margaret Carey and Eoin J.

"This study investigated whether there is empirical support for the current EU regulation mandating breaks of at least 10â?¯min after each period of 20â?¯min continuously reviewing X-ray images in airport security screening. As a second goal, it examined whether providing more autonomy to airport security officers (in the form of spontaneous rest breaks and adaptable automation) would improve their performance and subjective state. Seventy-two student participants had to indicate the presence (or absence) of a threat item (either a gun or a knife) in a series of grey-scaled X-ray images of cabin baggage. Three work-rest schedules were examined: spontaneous breaks (i.e. participants could take breaks at any time), two 5-min breaks and two 10-min breaks during a 1-h testing session. Furthermore, half of the participants were assisted in their task by an adaptable support system offering three levels of automation: (1) no support, (2) cues indicating the presence of a potential threat item, and (3) cues indicating the exact location of a potential threat item. Results showed no performance differences between break regimes, which suggests that there may be viable alternatives to the current EU regulations. It also emerged that providing participants with adaptable automation did not lead to better detection performance but resulted in a less positive response bias than participants without automatic support. Implications for current aviation security regulations are discussed.","Adaptable automation, Airport security, Visual inspection, System reliability, Performance",Alain Chavaillaz and Adrian Schwaninger and Stefan Michel and Juergen Sauer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701930064X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.04.004,0003-6870,2019,66--75,79,Applied Ergonomics,Work design for airport security officers: Effects of rest break schedules and adaptable automation,article,CHAVAILLAZ201966
"Sit-to-stand workstations have been deployed in office environments to reduce sedentary behavior and improve worker's health. However, efforts to initiate and sustain long-term usage of sit-stand workstations has been a challenge, with primarily anecdotal evidence suggesting many employees cease using their sit-stand workstations once the newness diminishes. To objectively determine sit-stand workstation usage and what impact computer-based prompts would have on sit-stand desk use and sustainability, 200 office workers (118 control and 82 treatment) in two different geographic locations were continuously monitored over a 4 Â½ month period, which consisted of a 6-week baseline and a 3-month experimental period. During the 3-month experimental period, computer-based prompts elicited a 229% increase in daily standing transitions which was sustained over the entire 3 months with 40% of the participants adhering to a pre-determined sit to stand schedule. These findings indicate that the use of computer-based prompts can be used to motivate employees to change their behavior regarding the use of sit-to-stand workstations.","Behavior change, Sit-stand desks, Motivation, Body discomfort",Gregory Garrett and Hongwei Zhao and Adam Pickens and Ranjana Mehta and Leigh Preston and Amy Powell and Mark Benden,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701830348X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.04.003,0003-6870,2019,17--24,79,Applied Ergonomics,Computer-based Prompt's impact on postural variability and sit-stand desk usage behavior; a cluster randomized control trial,article,GARRETT201917
"Manual material handling (MMH) is associated with the development of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). One-handed carrying is a particularly challenging form of MMH. Age and obesity have been increasing among the general and working populations in the United States and worldwide. While older and obese workers are more susceptible to MSDs in comparison to younger, healthy workers, the effects of one-handed carrying on trunk muscle activity among these populations have not been comprehensively studied. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of age and obesity on trunk muscle activity of six trunk muscle pairs during one-handed carrying of different loads. The results suggest that older and obese individuals do not exhibit considerably larger muscle activity than young and non-obese individuals while carrying a load of approximately 10â?¯kg in one hand for relatively short distances. Accordingly, 10â?¯kg appears to be an acceptable load to be occasionally carried in one hand by older and/or obese individuals from a muscle activity perspective.","One-handed carrying, Older, Obese, Muscle activity",Mohamed Badawy and Mark C.

"A field study was conducted to investigate the probabilities of human participants to detect a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at a certain distance. A Phantom 4 quadcopter was remotely controlled to hover at one of the 32 pre-determined locations in the air. Thirty-two participants on the ground were requested to judge if they could see the quadcopter on a four-point scale: 1. definitely yes, 2. probably yes, 3. probably no, and 4. definitely no. The participants also responded whether they could hear the quadcopter on the same four-point scale. Logistic regression models were established to estimate the probability of detecting the quadcopter in the air, both visually and auditory. When navigating a quadcopter flying away from the operator, the sound stimulus diminished and then disappeared earlier than that of the sight of the quadcopter. The results of the study indicated that the probability of visual detection of the quadcopter at a distance of 300â?¯m was approximately 0.3. When adopting a 50% probability of visual detection and the â??definitely or probably yesâ? criterion, the estimated distance of line-of-sight was 245â?¯m. The corresponding visual angle was 0.065Â°. The information in this study is valuable for drone operators, operator training institutes, and drone designers.

"Ensuring a healthier working environment is of utmost importance for companies and global health organizations. In manufacturing plants, the ergonomic assessment of adopted working postures is indispensable to avoid risk factors of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This process receives high research interest and requires extracting plausible postural information as a preliminary step. This paper presents a semi-automated end-to-end ergonomic assessment system of adopted working postures. The proposed system analyzes the human posture holistically, does not rely on any attached markers, uses low cost depth technologies and leverages the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In particular, we train a deep convolutional neural network to analyze the articulated posture and predict body joint angles from a single depth image. The proposed method relies on learning from synthetic training images to allow simulating several physical tasks, different body shapes and rendering parameters and obtaining a highly generalizable model. The corresponding ground truth joint angles have been generated using a novel inverse kinematics modeling stage. We validated the proposed system in real environments and achieved a joint angle mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.19Â±1.57â?? and a rapid upper limb assessment (RULA) grand score prediction accuracy of 89% with Kappa index of 0.71 which means substantial agreement with reference scores. This work facilities evaluating several ergonomic assessment metrics as it provides direct access to necessary postural information overcoming the need for computationally expensive post-processing operations.","Ergonomics, MSDs, RULA, RGB-D, Deep learning, ConvNet, CNN, Posture analysis",Ahmed Abobakr and Darius Nahavandi and Mohammed Hossny and Julie Iskander and Mohammed Attia and Saeid Nahavandi and Marty Smets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300894,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.05.004,0003-6870,2019,75--88,80,Applied Ergonomics,RGB-D ergonomic assessment system of adopted working postures,article,ABOBAKR201975
"We present a unique data visualisation approach, called workflow time charts, to illustrate the sequential and multi-dimensional nature of work in emergency departments. Using 40â?¯h of data from direct observations of emergency physicians, we applied the charts to visualise patient-stratified physiciansâ?? work as a continuous temporal process, including distinguishing tasks of different types and representing external prompts (similar to interruptions) and multitasking performance. The charts showed frequent changes in the nature of observed activities, with interleaved multitasking a constant feature and external prompts often clustered in time. Evidence of seniority-related differences in work were apparent with consultants switching between more concurrent patients and receiving more frequent clinical prompts than junior physicians, illustrating their overseeing and advice-giving role. The ubiquity of interleaved multitasking suggests a need to focus on developing individual strategies to support frequent cognitive switching. Work that appears fragmented at physician level may form part of a flexible and robust system, rather than an error-prone set of isolated individual behaviours.","Clinical work, Interruptions, Multitasking, Emergency department, Visualisation",Scott R.

"This study compared the spinal moments (i.e., peak and cumulative moments acting on the L5/S1 joint), kinematics (i.e., peak trunk and knee angles) and work pace of workers, when either removing a box from a shelf or depositing a box on a shelf, under two conditions: as a single task or as part of a combined task. An experiment was conducted, in which the subjects performed the tasks and were recorded using a motion capture system. An automated program was developed to process the motion capture data. The results showed that, when the removing and depositing tasks were performed as part of a combined task (rather than as single tasks), subjects experienced smaller peak and cumulative spinal moments and they performed the tasks faster.

"Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate the accumulation of fatigue over a two-week offshore period. In particular, the effects of (1) time-of-day and days-on-shift as well as (2) acute and chronic sleep loss on the rate at which fatigue accumulates were investigated. Methods 42 day-shift offshore workers were examined. Fatigue was measured using pre- and post-shift scores on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Total sleep time was measured using actigraphy (Motionwatch8, Camntech). Data was analyzed using a linear mixed model analyses. Results Average sleep loss per night was 92â?¯min (95%CI: 89.6â??94.0; pâ?¯<â?¯.001). Mean cumulative sleep loss across the study was 21:20hrs (SDâ?¯=â?¯08:10hrs) over the 14 days. Chronic sleep loss was significantly related to a modest increase in sleepiness (KSS) across the shift (95%CI: 0.01â??0.17; pâ?¯=â?¯.020) and in post-shift scores (95%CI:.07â??0.19; pâ?¯<â?¯.001). Time-of-day (95%CI: 0.63 to â??0.01; pâ?¯=â?¯.042) and days-on-shift (95%CI: 0.03â??0.08; pâ?¯<â?¯.001) as well as their interaction (95%CI: 0.08 to â??0.00; pâ?¯=â?¯.027) influenced the rate at which fatigue accumulated over a two-week offshore period. Conclusions Pre- and post-shift fatigue accumulate in different ways over the two-week offshore period. The accumulation of post-shift fatigue scores was positively related to successive days-on-shift and chronic sleep loss. Our results suggest that prolonging offshore periods will likely result in elevated fatigue risk.

"Among the possible approaches for building virtual environments (VE), researchers have recently started employing game engines (GE). Although there are already studies reporting the usage of GE-based VEs, their potential for supporting a more comprehensive workspace analysis (considering the physical, organizational and cognitive aspects of work) has yet to be better understood. The main goal of this paper is to investigate how a GE-based simulation of a real workplace (a local control room in an oil refinery) can be used as a tool by practitioners and researchers in evaluating work conditions. Participants (nâ?¯=â?¯38) were recruited to explore the simulation and evaluate the workplace dimensions represented. A comparison between the scores participants attributed to the work dimensions and the scores assigned by the ergonomics consultant was performed through a statistical test to verify whether they significantly differed or not. Out of the 10 aspects evaluated, only 3 presented significant differences, thus showing that GE suitability for ergonomics analysis is conditioned to the aspects represented. Qualitative data analysis highlighted participants' perception of GEs potential as an analysis and educational tool, as well as a medium for fostering communication and stakeholder involvement in the design process.","Virtual environments, Simulation, Game engine",Esdras Paravizo and Daniel Braatz,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.01.001,0003-6870,2019,22--28,77,Applied Ergonomics,"Using a game engine for simulation in ergonomics analysis, design and education: An exploratory study",article,PARAVIZO201922
"The commitment of managers is one of the facilitators of participatory ergonomics (PE). However, to achieve this, practical practitionersâ?? strategies vary depending on the organizational context and type of stakeholder and are poorly described in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to describe and to analyze the process and strategies that led to senior managers commitment during a decision-making intervention in a subcontracting context. A reflexive practice method was used to describe strategies implemented during a multi-site research project focusing on musculoskeletal disorders prevention in the meat processing sector. A 3 levels commitment method was developed which included: each subcontractor individually, subcontractors together, and subcontractors with their main contractor. Four strategies from the literature were firstly implemented: the creation of a steering committee, the identification of tendencies to act, the transfer of knowledge and moderation of collective discussion. An additional new strategy based on the sharing of a common interest â?? knife sharpening and maintenance was necessary to achieve the commitment. These results reinforce the importance of stakeholder strategies commitment in PE. A greater consideration for developing a valid framework is needed.","Manager commitment, Participatory ergonomics, Reflexivity, Subcontracting, Meat processing",A. Cuny-Guerrier and A.

"We compared three passive exoskeleton designs in a mock drilling task under three precision requirements levels, defined by required hole sizes, in terms of physical demands (perceived exertion and muscular activation) and quality. The investigated designs were: 1) an upper-body exoskeleton mainly supporting the shoulder; and both 2) full-body, and 3) upper-body exoskeletons, each with connected supernumerary arms. At a fixed pace, participants (nâ?¯=â?¯12) repeated â??drillingâ? two same-sized holes for 2â?¯min. A fairly consistent result across exoskeleton designs was that higher precision demands increased some muscle activation levels and deteriorated quality. Designs with supernumerary arms led to the largest reductions in quality and increased physical demands overall, mainly in the low back. The shoulder-focused exoskeleton reduced shoulder demands but appeared to reduce quality with the highest precision requirement. Although future work is needed under more diverse/realistic scenarios, these results might be useful to (re)design occupational exoskeletons.","Exoskeleton, Performance, Precision",Saad Alabdulkarim and Sunwook Kim and Maury A.

"Distraction constitute one of the â??five fatalâ?? behaviours that contribute to road trauma, and some people may be more susceptible to it than others. It is also known that a greater ability to predict danger is related to a lower probability of suffering accidents. It could be hypothesised that drivers with a higher tendency to distraction are worse at predicting traffic hazards, but to what extent might driving experience serve to mitigate this tendency to distraction? The current study collected self-reported attentional errors from drivers by using the Attention-Related Driving Errors Scale (ARDES-Spain) in order to examine whether novice drivers suffered from inattention more than experienced drivers. The results demonstrated that novice drivers scored more highly on ARDES than experienced drivers. ARDES scores were then related to performance in a Hazard Prediction test, where participants had to report what hazard was about to happen in a series of video clips that occlude just as the hazard begins to develop. While experienced drivers were better at the Hazard Prediction test than novice drivers, those participants who reported fewer attention errors were also better able to detect the upcoming hazard following occlusion. In addition, our results demonstrate a relationship between self-reported attentional errors and the ability to predict upcoming hazards on the road, with driving experience having a moderating role. In the case of novice drivers, as their scores in the Manoeuvring Errors ARDES factor increase, their ability in Hazard Prediction diminishes, while for experienced drivers the increase is not significant. Guidance on how to improve training for drivers in order to mitigate the effects of inattention on driving safety can be addressed.","Hazard perception, Hazard detection, Distraction, Inattention, Risk estimation, Driving experience, Hazard prediction, Driving, Road safety, Novice, Experienced drivers",Candida Castro and Jose-Luis Padilla and Pablo Doncel and Pedro Garcia-Fernandez and Petya Ventsislavova and Eduardo Eisman and David Crundall,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301188,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102886,0003-6870,2019,102886,81,Applied Ergonomics,How are distractibility and hazard prediction in driving related?

"We investigated the effect of handrail height on the timing and speed of reach-to-grasp balance reactions during slope descent, in fourteen younger and thirteen older adults. Participants walked along an 8Â° slope mounted to a robotic platform. Platform perturbations evoked reach-to-grasp reactions. Handrail height did not significantly affect handrail contact time (i.e., time from perturbation onset to handrail contact) or movement time (i.e., time from EMG latency to handrail contact). Participants appeared to compensate for the increased hand-handrail distance with higher rails via increased peak upward hand speed, and decreased vertical handrail overshoot. Aging was associated with slower EMG latency, reduced hand acceleration time, and increased hand deceleration time. Our findings suggest that participants were not disadvantaged by higher handrails from reach-to-grasp timing or speed perspectives, and that other metrics (e.g., center-of-mass control after grasping) may be more important when evaluating handrail designs for balance recovery.","Balance recovery, Handrail design, Aging, Falls, Injury prevention",Vicki Komisar and Brian E.

"The purpose of this study is to construct an aircraft seat discomfort scale and verify the evidence of its validity and reliability. We developed a questionnaire and presented it to 1500 Brazilian passengers at an airport. The data analysis included: 1) factor analysis; 2) the analysis of the items to be used in the scale created using Item Response Theory. The scale covered all levels, from â??without discomfortâ? to â??maximum discomfortâ?. At the level of minimal, a passenger feels that the aircraft seat is cramped and has little space. Discomfort tends to increase when passengers are unable to perform desired activities (eg: reading, sleeping), which causes irritation and disappointment. The maximum discomfort level occurs when noise disrupts activities and an aircraft seat is considered hard. The scale developed presented indications that it is reliable and valid, proving to be a useful tool for identifying levels of discomfort in aircraft seats.","Discomfort, Aircraft seat, Scale, Item response theory",Lizandra da Silva Menegon and Silvana Ligia Vincenzi and Dalton Francisco de Andrade and Pedro Alberto Barbetta and Peter Vink and Eugenio AndrÃ©s DÃ­az Merino,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018307579,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.12.015,0003-6870,2019,1--8,77,Applied Ergonomics,An aircraft seat discomfort scale using item response theory,article,MENEGON20191
"Prolonged sitting, common in many workplaces, reduces blood flow to the lower limb and has negative health outcomes. CoreChair is an active-sitting chair that encourages increased movement to help mitigate these outcomes. Physiological and cognitive measures were recorded in ten subjects over 4â?¯h of sitting in both the CoreChair and a traditional office chair. Sitting in both chairs led to increases in calf circumference (pâ?¯<â?¯0.0001), reduced tactile sensitivity (pâ?¯=â?¯0.02), and a cognitive decline in attention (pâ?¯=â?¯0.035) over time. However, the increase in calf circumference was smaller in the CoreChair at the second (pâ?¯=â?¯0.017) and third hour (pâ?¯=â?¯0.012) compared to the traditional chair. Additionally, for the attention task, the traditional chair generated more attention-task errors (pâ?¯=â?¯0.005), while no changes were observed with the CoreChair (pâ?¯=â?¯0.13). These findings suggest that during prolonged sitting CoreChair may have modest physiological and cognitive benefits compared to a traditional chair.","Prolonged sitting, Active sitting, Ergonomics, Monofilaments, Venous pooling, Attention",Joseph Triglav and Erika Howe and Jaskirat Cheema and Blaire Dube and Mark J.

"Driving simulation is widely used to answer important applied research questions, however, it is vital for specific driving tasks to undergo appropriate behavioural validation testing. Many previous validation studies have used simple driving tasks and measured relatively low-level vehicle control. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether driversâ?? visual attention at intersections with different levels of demand, are similar in the simulator and on the road. Unlike simpler driving tasks, crossing intersections requires complex interactions with other vehicles governed by sequences of head and eye movements that may not be accurately captured in a simulated environment. In the current study we directly compare performance at simulated junctions with the same participants' behaviour in a real car. We compared driversâ?? visual attention in a high-fidelity driving simulator (instrumented car, 360-degree screen) and on-road in both low and medium demand driving situations. The low and medium demand driving situations involved the same motor movements, containing straight on, right turn and left turn manoeuvres. The low demand situations were controlled by the road environment and traffic lights, whereas medium demand situations required the driver to scan the environment and decide when it was safe to pull out into the junction. Natural junctions in Nottingham were used for the on-road phase and the same junctions were recreated in the simulator with traffic levels matched to those that were encountered on the real roads. The frequency and size of drivers' head movements were not significantly different between manoeuvres performed in the simulator and those conducted when driving on real roads. This suggests that drivers' broad search strategies in the simulator are representative of real-world driving. These strategies did change as a function of task demand - compared to low demand situations, behaviour at the medium demand junctions was characterised by longer junction crossing times, more head movements, shorter fixation durations and larger saccadic amplitudes. Although patterns of head movements were equivalent on road and in the simulator, there were differences in more fine-grained measures of eye-movements. Mean fixation durations were longer in the simulator compared to on-road, particularly in low-demand situations. We interpret this as evidence for lower levels of visual engagement with the simulated environment compared to the real world, at least when the task demands are low. These results have important implications for driving research. They suggest that high fidelity driving simulators can be useful tools for investigating driversâ?? visual attention at junctions, particularly when the driving task is of at least moderate demand.","Simulator validity, Junctions, Eye movements, Demand",Chloe J.

"Display clutter is a widely studied phenomenon in ergonomics, where information density and other properties of task-relevant visualizations are related to effective user performance and visual attention. This paper examines the impact of clutter in the context of financial stock visualizations. Depending on their expertise, traders can use a variety of different cues to judge the current and future value of a stock and to assess its riskiness. In our study, two groups of participants (novices and experts) judge the riskiness of 28 pairs of stocks under two clutter conditions (low and high). Consistency of judgments and group concordance serve as measures for judgment performance, while mean fixation duration, fixation frequency, and transition matrix density are employed to capture visual attention. Our results reveal significant effects of display clutter and expertise on both the performance measures as well as the visual attention measures.","Display clutter, Expertise, Eye-tracking, Stocks",Svetlana Ognjanovic and Manfred ThÃ¼ring and Ryan O.

"Service robots that mimic human social behavior can appear polite. We tested the social and behavioral efficacy and legibility of two kinesic courtesy cues on people's approval of a service robot. In a repeated-measures design, 29 volunteers were randomly assigned to two test situations: A participant and the robot simultaneously approached a bottleneck either next to each other or from opposite ends. Nested within these two situations were three courtesy cue conditions: The robot moved without any explicit courtesy cues, stopped, or moved aside and then stopped. We found statistically significant effects of the courtesy cues on people's self-reported appreciation and the legibility of the robot's motion. Behavioral observations indicated that the robot exhibiting two courtesy cues was less disruptive to the human's own actions and was thus more behaviorally effective. This research demonstrates that kinesic politeness cues can be used effectively in the motion design of service robots.","Human-robot interaction, Motion planning, Autonomous agents, System design, Social processes",Florian G.

"There has been a considerable amount of research to conceptualize how cognition handle multitasking situations. Despite these efforts, it is still not clear how task parameters shape attentionnal resources allocation. For instance, many research have suggested that difficulty levels could explain these conflicting observations and very few have considered other factors such as task importance. In the present study, twenty participants had to carry out two N-Back tasks simultaneously, each subtask having distinct difficulty (0,1 or 2-Back) and importance (1 or 3 points) levels. Participants's cumulative dwell time were collected to assess their attentional strategies. Results showed that depending on the global level of difficulty (combination of the two levels of difficulty), attentional resources of people were driven either by the subtask difficulty (under low-global-difficulty) or the subtask importance (under high-global-difficulty), in a non-compensatory way. We discussed these results in terms of decision-making heuristics and metacognition.","Dual task, Attentional processes, Metacognition, Working memory, Decision-making",BenoÃ®t ValÃ©ry and Nadine Matton and SÃ©bastien Scannella and FrÃ©dÃ©ric Dehais,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300808,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.04.012,0003-6870,2019,1--8,80,Applied Ergonomics,Global difficulty modulates the prioritization strategy in multitasking situations,article,VALERY20191
"We investigated whether motion sickness analogous to carsickness can be studied in a moving base simulator, despite the limited motion envelope. Importantly, to avoid simulator sickness, vision outside the simulator cabin was restricted. Participants (Nâ?¯=â?¯16) were exposed blindfolded to 15-min lateral sinusoidal motion at 0.2â?¯Hz and 0.35â?¯Hz on separate days. These conditions were selected to realize optimal provocativeness of the stimulus given the simulator's maximum displacement and knowledge on frequency-acceleration interactions for motion sickness. Average motion sickness on an 11-point scale was 2.21â?¯Â±â?¯1.97 for 0.2â?¯Hz and 1.93â?¯Â±â?¯1.94 for 0.35â?¯Hz. The motion sickness increase over time was comparable to that found in studies using actual vehicles. We argue that motion base simulators can be used to incite motion sickness analogous to carsickness, provided considerable restrictions on vision.

"Does comfort in a restaurant influence people's experienced hospitality? Effects of seating comfort and acoustic comfort on the experience of hospitality were examined by means of a 2 x 2 between subjects experiment among 262 customers of a self-service restaurant, using the EH-scale measuring the experiential factors care, comfort and inviting. In line with theory on embodiment, MANOVA and mediation analysis showed that comfortable seating positively influences mental comfort, which subsequently increases the experience of hospitality (comfort factor). Extra ambient sound (acoustic discomfort) cancels out this effect. Also, people's desire to sit matters: people with a low desire to sit interpret comfortable seats as more caring instead of comfort. Regarding the discussion on (dis)comfort: seating comfort, not discomfort, accounted for the effects. Altogether, the hospitality experienced in a restaurant may be enhanced by offering comfortable seats, making customers feel more comfortable, physically and mentally.","Comfort, Seating, Hospitality, Embodiment, Service environment",Ruth Pijls and Mirjam Galetzka and Brenda H.

"We performed a randomised controlled trial comparing two kinds of earcons that could provide intermittent pulse oximetry information about a patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR). Timbre-earcons represented SpO2 levels with different levels of timbre, and pitch-earcons with different levels of pitch. Both kinds of earcons represented HR with tremolo. Participants using pitch-earcons identified SpO2 levels alone, and both SpO2 plus HR levels, significantly better than participants using timbre-earcons: pâ?¯<â?¯.001 in both cases. However, there was no difference between earcon conditions in how effectively HR was identified, pâ?¯=â?¯.422. For both kinds of earcons, identification of SpO2 levels was more compromised by simultaneous changes in HR than identification of HR levels was compromised by simultaneous changes in SpO2, suggesting asymmetric integrality.

"Traffic signs are used to control and regulate traffic and create a safe environment for road users. Therefore, it is of great importance to ensure that road signs are easily understood and easily learned, especially by drivers. The current study, conducted in Israel, focused on the ability to learn unfamiliar road signs and on the effect of the compliance of those signs with principles of physical and conceptual compatibility (ergonomic principles for symbol design). A preliminary experiment tested the extent to which each of 30 signs, not used in Israel, complied with the compatibility principle. Based on this evaluation, the signs were divided into two distinctive groups â?? â??ergonomicâ? signs and â??non-ergonomicâ? signs. In the second part of the study, we tested the differences between the two groups of signs in terms of comprehension and learnability, conducting recognition-recall tests among 33 teenagers without a driving license. Results showed a significant design main effect, with a higher comprehension level associated with the ergonomic signs compared to the non-ergonomic signs. A significant learnability main effect was also found, with comprehension levels in the recall test significantly higher than in the recognition test for both groups of signs. In addition, the probability for improvement in comprehension based on learning the meanings of the signs was higher among the ergonomic group of signs. These findings demonstrate the importance of ergonomic design in shaping the understandability and learnability of road signs. The implications of the current results can be most relevant to tourists, as well as novice drivers.","Traffic signs, Ergonomic principles, Compatibility, Recognition-recall, Learnability",Tamar Ben-Bassat,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300523,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.02.009,0003-6870,2019,137--147,78,Applied Ergonomics,Are ergonomically designed road signs more easily learned?,article,BENBASSAT2019137
"The use of colours is a prevalent and effective tool for improving design. Understanding the effect of colours on attention is crucial for designers that wish to understand how their interfaces will be used. Previous research has consistently shown that attention is biased towards colour. However, despite previous evidence indicating that colours should be treated individually, it has thus far not been investigated whether this difference is reflected in individual effects on attention. To address this, a visual search experiment was conducted that tested the attentional guidance of six individual colours (red,blue, green, yellow, orange, purple) in increasingly complex displays. Results showed that the individual colours differed significantly in their level of guidance of attention, and that these differences increased as the visual complexity of the display increased.

"The relationships of demographic and anthropometric characteristics (17 dimensions related to the hand, wrist, and arm) with four different pinch strengths (lateral pinch, key pinch, three-jaw chuck pinch and tip-to-tip pinch strengths) were evaluated among 196 (96 males and 100 females) young adults aged 19â??30 years. For both dominant and non-dominant hands, the lateral pinch was greatest, followed by the key pinch, three-jaw chuck pinch and tip-to-tip pinch strengths. Mean pinch strengths of the dominant and non-dominant hands of females varied between 62%â??78% and 61%â??73% of those exerted by males, respectively. Strength of the dominant hand was 5.3%â??7.5% stronger than of that of the non-dominant hand, with this difference being generally higher in females than in males. Hand length and forearm length showed the strongest correlation with all types of pinch strengths exerted by both the dominant and non-dominant hands. In the partial least squares analysis, 10 out of 17 anthropometric indices including hand length, forearm length, arm length, middle finger width, thumb length, index finger width, thumb width, wrist depth, palm depth and index finger depth had considerable loadings in the extracted component, explaining 37% of the total variance.

"Accurate estimations of manual arm strength (MAS) are crucial in the evaluation of occupational force demands relative to population capacity. Most current strength predictions assume force application with a vertically oriented handle, but it is unknown how uni-manual force capability changes as a function of handle orientation and hand location. This study evaluated the effect of handle orientation on MAS throughout the reach envelope. Fifteen female participants exerted maximum forces in six directions (i.e. superior, inferior, anterior, posterior, medial, lateral), at five different hand locations, and MAS was measured with the handle oriented at 0Â° (i.e. horizontal), 45Â°, 90Â° (i.e. vertical) and 135Â°. Handle orientation affected MAS in all but the anterior exertion direction, with significant interactions between hand location and grip orientation existing for the superior and inferior directions.

Results showed that of the number of adjustable functions available on their office chair (Mâ?¯=â?¯5.39, SDâ?¯=â?¯2.3), participants knew fewer than half of them (Mâ?¯=â?¯2.51, SDâ?¯=â?¯1.52) and used even less (Mâ?¯=â?¯1.86, SDâ?¯=â?¯1.21). Fifty-three percent of participants knew two or less and 73% had used only two or less. Ten percent had used none. Results suggested physical needs (such as increased comfort or postural change) were a strong driver for previous chair adjustment behaviour. Perceived cognitive barriers played a more significant role in limiting chair adjustment knowledge and use than physical or organizational barriers. Highly adjustable office chairs have the possibility of satisfying the adjustment needs of most end-users. However, adjustable chair functions need to be both available and known in order to be used.","Office chair adjustment, Chair controls, Chair adjustment barrier",Diana Underwood and Ruth Sims,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018307348,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.12.007,0003-6870,2019,100--106,77,Applied Ergonomics,"Do office workers adjust their chairs?

"Wearable technology has many industrial applications. Optimal use adherence and outcomes largely depend on employee acceptance of the technology. This study determined factors that predict employee acceptance of wearables. An online survey of 1273 employed adults asked about demographics, job and organizational characteristics, experience with and beliefs about wearables, and willingness to use wearables. Use cases focused on workplace safety elicited the highest acceptance. An employee's performance expectancy and their organizational safety climate were common predictors of acceptance across use cases. Positive past experiences coincided with involving employees in choosing the device and adequately informing them about data use. Organizations intending to implement wearable technology should (a) focus its use on improving workplace safety, (b) advance a positive safety climate, (c) ensure sufficient evidence to support employees' beliefs that the wearable will meet its objective, and (d) involve and inform employees in the process of selecting and implementing wearable technology.","Technology acceptance, Wearable technology, Safety climate, Industrial workplace ergonomics, Work measurement",Jesse V.

"Interferences during the boarding procedure are one of the main reasons of delay and increased turnaround time, becoming a relevant problem for airlines. Observations of the boarding process and questionnaires inside the aircraft revealed three main bottlenecks during the boarding process: (1) Hand luggage: Storage space is not sufficient and/or not used efficiently; (2) Preparation: Passengers are not well prepared for the boarding process; and (3) Communication: Audio announcements are unclear and unfocused. By translating these bottlenecks as possibilities for improvement, solutions were designed for the airport and aircraft interiors to reduce boarding time and improve the passenger boarding experience. Concepts ranged from an app to scan your hand luggage at home and make a reservation for overhead bin space; to a redesigned waiting area to help passengers prepare for boarding; to new boarding methods and redesigned aircraft seats. In this paper, several design concepts are presented in more detail.","Airplane boarding, Passenger behaviour, Boarding time reduction, Hand luggage",Suzanne {Hiemstra-Van Mastrigt} and Richard Ottens and Peter Vink,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018307580,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.12.016,0003-6870,2019,16--21,77,Applied Ergonomics,Identifying bottlenecks and designing ideas and solutions for improving aircraft passengersâ?? experience during boarding and disembarking,article,HIEMSTRAVANMASTRIGT201916
"Training for safe lifting techniques is used by employers to lower their workers' exposure to risk of workplace injuries. To determine effectiveness of training, 266 attendees at two professional conferences were asked to identify and demonstrate their preferred lift technique with the demonstration being an ideal floor-to-waist height lift of a10-kg weighted crate. â??Bend your kneesâ?? was the most frequent preferred cue for each of the self-reported participant groups: untrained (nâ?¯=â?¯65), trained (nâ?¯=â?¯86), and trainers (nâ?¯=â?¯115) according to safe lifting techniques. The demonstrations showed that this cue was incorporated into the skill of lifting by all groups. Trained participants showed a stronger conformity for depth of squat; but, the overall variability suggested a lack of consensus on the ideal depth of squat. The trained group experienced less loading at L5/S1 (pâ?¯=â?¯.021) compared to untrained that was countered by higher loading of the knee (pâ?¯=â?¯.046). Trainers showed lower knee (pâ?¯=â?¯.006) and shoulder (pâ?¯=â?¯.03) loading with similar L5/S1 loading as the trained participants suggesting a broader set of criteria for safe lifting. While the study population was likely biased towards a common understanding of safe lifting techniques given the conferences were for ergonomists and safety professionals, the results provided valuable insight into potential knowledge gaps, and key messaging that is being delivered and integrated into one's knowledge; a program review of lift training is recommended.","Lifting methods, Training, Kinetics, Kinematics",Mohammad Abdoli-Eramaki and Milena Agababova and Joseph Janabi and Elena Pasko and Caroline Damecour,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701930050X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.02.007,0003-6870,2019,120--126,78,Applied Ergonomics,Evaluation and comparison of lift styles for an ideal lift among individuals with different levels of training,article,ABDOLIERAMAKI2019120
"The purpose of this work was to assess the feasibility of using a head mounted display with a motion capture system to simulate real world occupational tasks. Participants performed a pointing task under 3 conditions: (1) real environment (REA), (2) virtual environment with auditory stimulus (VEA) and (3) virtual environment with visual stimulus (VEV). End point error, movement time and peak fingertip velocity were calculated for each discrete point event. Upper extremity joint angles were calculated at the end-state for each point and did not significantly differ between real and virtual conditions. There was significantly greater target error in virtual conditions, compared to the real condition. Peak pointing velocity was slower and movement time was longer during virtual conditions. The similarity of joint angles between real and virtual conditions suggests future use of posture-based ergonomic assessments for use with virtual reality task simulations using Oculus Rift and Siemens Jack.","Virtual reality, Simulation, Training, Posture, Joint angles, Digital human model",Michael A.

"Mixed prototyping, combining virtual and physical prototypes, is an emerging method used to aid in usability testing. This study aims to determine when to use a mixed prototype and how to choose its fidelity to validate the usability testing results and reduce the prototyping cost. A 2Ã?2 between-subject experiment was designed to investigate the effects of the media (head-mounted display versus computer monitor) and physical interaction (using a tangible mock-up or not) on the usability evaluation results and other subjective measures. The experiment results showed that, when aesthetic and functional features are controlled, the non-functional mock-up facilitates users in finding problems regarding physical interaction and ergonomics. Media with high immersion positively influenced the usersâ?? subjective ratings. Based on the findings of this study, guidelines on how to choose the fidelity of the prototype during different stages of a usability test are suggested to help product developers find a cost-efficient way to conduct usability tests.","Usability test, Fidelity, Mixed prototype, Ergonomics",Xingchen Zhou and Pei-Luen Patrick Rau,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300912,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.05.007,0003-6870,2019,111--118,80,Applied Ergonomics,Determining fidelity of mixed prototypes: Effect of media and physical interaction,article,ZHOU2019111
"We aimed to investigate the effects of the visual complexity of in-vehicle information display and driver's age in a driving context. A driving simulator study was conducted where participants performed visual search tasks at different visual complexity levels while driving. Two groups were included, 20 younger drivers (mean ageâ?¯=â?¯28.75 years) and 14 older drivers (mean ageâ?¯=â?¯54.87 years). Older drivers were found to be more vulnerable to the effects of increased visual complexity when performing a visual search task. The task completion time of the younger group increased by about 20% (from 7.69â?¯s to 9.30â?¯s), while the older group increased by about 47% (from 8.92â?¯s to 13.14â?¯s). Further, the driving performance of the older group deteriorated, unlike the younger group. The subjective workload score supported the results of the objective performance measures. These differences can be explained by glance behavior. The total off-road glance duration of older drivers was longer than that of younger drivers, but the average off-road glance duration of younger drivers was longer. In other words, older drivers have a more conservative strategy when dealing with increased visual complexity in a driving context so as not to affect their driving. The findings of this study show that the visual complexity level has a significant effect on driving behaviors, especially in older drivers, which provides insights for designing in-vehicle information displays.","Visual complexity, In-vehicle information display, Age-related differences",Seul Chan Lee and Young Woo Kim and Yong Gu Ji,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301206,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102888,0003-6870,2019,102888,81,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of visual complexity of in-vehicle information display: Age-related differences in visual search task in the driving context,article,LEE2019102888
"Introduction A Minnesota union identified to researchers at the University of Minnesota a concern relevant to a possible relation between their daily workload and outcome of occupational injuries among a population of janitors. Objective To assess if the ergonomic workload is related to injuries among janitors. Methods Following an initial group discussion among janitors, which identified common and hazardous tasks potentially leading to occupational injuries, a questionnaire was developed, pre-tested, and distributed to the janitors. Questions addressed various exposures, including workload, and comprehensive information regarding injury occurrence over two six-month sequential periods (May 2016â??October 2016, November 2016â??April 2017). Quantitative ergonomic analyses were performed on a sub-group of janitors (nâ?¯=â?¯30); these included data collection to identify Borg Perceived Exertion (Borg) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) scores. Descriptive, multivariable with bias adjustment analyses were conducted on the resulting data. Results Eight tasks were found to be common for janitors. All average REBA scores for the tasks were identified in the high-risk category. The task of repeatedly emptying small trash cans (<25lb) was significantly related to injuries. Average Borg scores fell between the very light perceived exertion and somewhat difficult perceived exertion categories. Multivariable regression analyses indicated that age-sex-standardized ergonomic workload, measured by task frequencies and REBA or Borg scores, was positively related to injury occurrence. Conclusions Standardized ergonomic workload was positively related to injury occurrence. This information serves as a basis for further research and potential intervention efforts.","Janitors, Workload, Ergonomics, Injuries, Epidemiology",Adam Schwartz and Susan G.

"Scientific developments have enabled the application of virtual reality (VR) technology in various fields. However, this technology is disadvantaged by low recognition, existence of bias, lack of precision, and fatigue of text input in VR environments. To address these problems, this study proposed a spatial enhancement technique. This study investigated the effectiveness of spatial enhancement keys of a virtual keyboard from various angles and explored the impact of enhanced response time and enhanced protrusion distance on the spatial enhancement technology. Finally, the following conclusions are obtained: (1) The average text input performance of the keyboard using the spatial enhancement technique is significantly better than that of the ordinary virtual keyboard without using the spatial enhancement technique. (2) The recommended time interval for enhanced response time and the protrusion distance are 0â??100â?¯ms and 1.85 diopter, respectively. The keyboard angle insignificantly affects the input through the keyboard performance.","Virtual reality, Spatial enhancement technology, Text input",Zhen Yang and Cheng Chen and Yuqing Lin and Duming Wang and Hongting Li and Weidan Xu,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300596,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.03.006,0003-6870,2019,164--175,78,Applied Ergonomics,Effect of spatial enhancement technology on input through the keyboard in virtual reality environment,article,YANG2019164
"Roofers often suffer from musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) to their knees due to spending a large amount of time kneeling while performing work-related roofing activities on sloped rooftops. Several ergonomic studies have identified kneeling as a potential risk factor for knee injuries and disorders. Existing biomechanical models and sensor technologies used to assess work-related risk factors for different construction trades are not applicable in roof work settings especially on slanted rooftop surfaces. This work assesses the impacts of work-related factors, namely working posture and roof slope, on the potential risk of developing knee MSDs due to residential roofing tasks in a laboratory setting. Nine human subjects participated in the experiment and mimicked shingle installation on a slope-configurable wooden platform. Maximum angles of right and left knee flexion, abduction, adduction, and axial rotation (internal and external) were measured as risk indicators using a motion capture system under different roof slope settings. The results demonstrated that roof slope, working posture and their interaction may have significant impacts on developing knee MSDs during roofing activities. Knees are likely to be exposed to increased risk of MSDs due to working in a dynamic kneeling posture during shingle installation. In our study, flexion in both knees and adduction in the right knee were found lower in high-pitched rooftops; however, abduction in the left knee and internal rotation in the right knee were found higher during shingle installation. Hence proper attention is needed for these situations. This study provides useful information about the impact of roof work settings on knee MSDs development, which may facilitate effective interventions such as education, training, and tools to prevent knee injuries in construction roofing tasks.","Knee musculoskeletal disorders, Risk assessment, Construction safety, Ergonomic practices",Scott P.

"Despite its importance, research examining the effectiveness of different egress warnings in fire emergencies has been sparse. This research examines language-based warnings presented visually in Experiment 1 and spoken format in Experiment 2 on their rated suitability as fire egress warnings. Two types of phrases were manipulated: egress immediacy and egress directives. Phrase ordering was also varied. Both experiments demonstrated a minimal fire warning without egress information is perceived less acceptable than warnings with egress information. The warnings rated as most acceptable contained egress directives indicating how to evacuate safely and that it should be done quickly. Furthermore, analyses on warning length revealed longer, specific warnings were rated higher than shorter warnings. However, data in Experiment 2 suggested the longest statements were rated lower than ones that were somewhat shorter.

"The objective of this study was to quantify head flexion when using a smartphone while walking. Head flexion angle in the sagittal plane was measured from twenty-eight young users when conducting one-handed web-browsing while walking, two-handed texting while walking, and walking upright on a 60-m walkway. Participants walked with the head flexed 38.5Â° (median angle) during the two-handed texting and it was significantly greater (pâ?¯<â?¯0.05) than that of the one-handed web-browsing (31.1Â°) as well as of upright walking (â??1.2Â°). The study results indicated that using a smartphone while walking would pose a larger load to the neck musculature compared to when walking without using a phone, and the load would be greater for two-handed texting than for one-handed browsing among the two smartphone tasks. The findings of this study can be used to inform smartphone users of potential risks of smartphone use while walking.","Text neck, Smartphone, Mobile phone, Walking, Head posture",Hyeseon Han and Gwanseob Shin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019301164,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102884,0003-6870,2019,102884,81,Applied Ergonomics,Head flexion angle when web-browsing and texting using a smartphone while walking,article,HAN2019102884
"Current decision support interventions for airway management in anaesthesia lack the application of Human Factors Engineering; leading to interventions that can be disruptive, inefficient and error-inducing. This study followed a decision-centred design process to identify decision support that can assist anaesthesia teams with challenging airway management situations. Field observations, Critical Decision Method interviews and focus groups were conducted to identify the most difficult decisions and their requirements. Data triangulation narrowed the focus to key decisions related to preparation and planning, and the transitioning between airway techniques during difficulties. Five decision-support interventions were identified and positively rated by anaesthesia team members in relation to their perceived effectiveness. An organized airway equipment trolley was chosen as the most beneficial decision support intervention. This study reiterated the key importance of both Human Factors Engineering and data triangulation when designing for healthcare.","Decision-centred design, Airway management, Cognitive task analysis",R.

"Ergonomics of household vacuuming has received little attention despite the pervasive nature of this task. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the level of muscular load of the upper extremity during carpeted floor vacuuming with household upright cleaners, which represent the most common type of vacuum cleaners in the US. Eighteen participants conducted five different vacuuming tasks with three upright cleaner models. Electromyography data from seven upper extremity muscles were recorded and analyzed. Normalized muscle activation levels were significantly higher in women compared to men across the five tasks for each muscle group. Median muscular load ranged from 4.5% to 47.5% of the maximum voluntary contraction capacity for female participants and from 2.7% to 23.6% for male participants. These results suggest that household vacuuming with upright vacuum cleaners is physically intensive work, especially for women.

"The relationships between sedentary lifestyle, sitting behaviour, and low back pain (LBP) remain controversial. In this study, we investigated the relationship between back pain and occupational sitting habits in 64 call-centre employees. A textile pressure mat was used to evaluate and parameterise sitting behaviour over a total of 400â?¯h, while pain questionnaires evaluated acute and chronic LBP. Seventy-five percent of the participants reported some level of either chronic or acute back pain. Individuals with chronic LBP demonstrated a possible trend (t-test not significant) towards more static sitting behaviour compared to their pain-free counterparts. Furthermore, a greater association was found between sitting behaviour and chronic LBP than for acute pain/disability, which is plausibly due to a greater awareness of pain-free sitting positions in individuals with chronic pain compared to those affected by acute pain.","Office chair, Pressure distribution, Low back pain, Sitting behaviour, Dynamic sitting",Carolin Bontrup and William R.

"Workers who kneel or squat frequently are at a high risk of developing knee pathologies. Knee SaversÂ® are wedge-shaped pads, worn on the lower calf by baseball catchers that aim to reduce this risk. This study examined how Knee SaversÂ® change the bilateral quadriceps muscle activity during dorsiflexed kneeling, and heels-up and flat-foot squatting. For twenty participants, integrated and peak electromyography (EMG) during descent and ascent phases, mean EMG during a 10-s static phase, and participantsâ?? subjective perception of muscle fatigue were compared between equipment conditions (with (W) and without (WO) Knee SaversÂ®). Knee SaversÂ® did not significantly reduce integrated or peak EMG during transitions into and out of the postures; however, they significantly reduced (pâ?¯<â?¯.03) mean EMG in five of six muscles during the static phase. These findings indicate potential for Knee SaversÂ® to reduce cumulative muscular effort and fatigue in applications where prolonged static kneeling or squatting are required.","Electromyography, Kneeling, Squatting, Ergonomics, Knee disorders",Shabnam Pejhan and Sean K.

"This study investigated the effect of wearing a passive lower-limb exoskeleton on physical load, kinematics, postural control, and discomfort. 45 healthy males participated and were exposed to three 21-min simulations, including screwing, cable-mounting, and clip-fitting. Each exposure comprised one of three exoskeleton statuses (standing, high and low sitting on exoskeleton) and three working distances (optimal, far, very far). The order of exoskeleton status and working distance were randomized across subjects. A force platform was used to calculate the mean center of pressure (COP) and absolute (SSABS) and relative static postural stability (SSREL) as measures of postural control as well as the weight transferred to the exoskeleton supports as indicator of physical load. Neck and back angles were recorded together with electrical activity of four bilateral muscles (trapezius, erector, vastus, gastrocnemius). Discomfort was recorded before and after each exposure on an 11-point numeric rating scale. Physical load decreased due to the exoskeleton carrying up to 64% of the subject's body mass. The COP remained within the base of support with the lowest values of static postural stability for high sitting (27%). During sitting, vastus activity increased (â?¼95â??135%) while gastrocnemius activity decreased (â?¼25%) compared to standing. Trapezius and erector activity levels showed only minor differences between exposures. Larger working distances resulted in a more anterior COP and increased erector activity. Standing without exoskeleton was related to less discomfort (0.5) than sitting on the exoskeleton (â?¼1.3). Working postures and distances changed SSREL and activity levels of the vastus, gastrocnemius, and erector, but not SSABS. However, postural stability did not approach a critical state in our simulations without external perturbations. Therefore, investigating exoskeletons in the field will provide useful information about their effectiveness and usability in dynamic working situations where external forces could occur.","Manual materials handling, Static postural stability, Industrial ergonomics",Tessy Luger and Robert Seibt and Timothy J.

"This study aims at comparing a Google Glass-based instructional application with a printed manual in mobile phone disassembly tasks. Thirty participants (15 males and 15 females) were recruited to perform tasks via three types of instructional methods (Google Glass-based augmented reality, Google Glass-based video, and a printed manual). The objective measures of performance (task completion time, error counts), and the subjective measures (NASA-Task Load Index, system usability scale) were considered. Additionally, visual fatigue was assessed by critical flicker fusion frequency and near point accommodation. According to the findings, although the printed manual method produced better results regarding mental workload and system usability, the augmented reality method improved error reduction and efficiency. Furthermore, the participants indicated that the displayed animations were helpful in locating the exact work-pieces.

"Touchscreen Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) are a well-established and popular choice to provide the primary control interface between driver and vehicle, yet inherently demand some visual attention. Employing a secondary device with the touchscreen may reduce the demand but there is some debate about which device is most suitable, with current manufacturers favouring different solutions and applying these internationally. We present an empirical driving simulator study, conducted in the UK and China, in which 48 participants undertook typical in-vehicle tasks utilising either a touchscreen, rotary-controller, steering-wheel-controls or touchpad. In both the UK and China, the touchscreen was the most preferred/least demanding to use, and the touchpad least preferred/most demanding, whereas the rotary-controller was generally favoured by UK drivers and steering-wheel-controls were more popular in China. Chinese drivers were more excited by the novelty of the technology, and spent more time attending to the devices while driving, leading to an increase in off-road glance time and a corresponding detriment to vehicle control. Even so, Chinese drivers rated devices as easier-to-use while driving, and felt that they interfered less with their driving performance, compared to their UK counterparts. Results suggest that the most effective solution (to maximise performance/acceptance, while minimising visual demand) is to maintain the touchscreen as the primary control interface (e.g. for top-level tasks), and supplement this with a secondary device that is only enabled for certain actions; moreover, different devices may be employed in different cultural markets. Further work is required to explore these recommendations in greater depth (e.g. during extended or real-world testing), and to validate the findings and approach in other cultural contexts.","Touchscreen, Rotary controller, Steering wheel control, Touchpad, Visual demand, Preferences, Driving performance, Workload, Character recognition, Culture, HMI, UK, China, Driver acceptance",David R.

"Vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC) is the main contributor to visual fatigue during immersion in virtual environments. Many studies have investigated the effects of VAC using 3D displays and expensive complex apparatus and setup to create natural and conflicting viewing conditions. However, a limited number of studies targeted virtual environments simulated using modern consumer-grade VR headsets. Our main objective, in this work, is to test how the modern VR headsets (VR simulated depth) could affect our vergence system, in addition to investigating the effect of the simulated depth on the eye-gaze performance. The virtual scenario used included a common virtual object (a cube) in a simple virtual environment with no constraints placed on the head and neck movement of the subjects. We used ocular biomechanics and eye tracking to compare between vergence angles in matching (ideal) and conflicting (real) viewing conditions. Real vergence angle during immersion was significantly higher than ideal vergence angle and exhibited higher variability which leads to incorrect depth cues that affects depth perception and also leads to visual fatigue for prolonged virtual experiences. Additionally, we found that as the simulated depth increases, the ability of users to manipulate virtual objects with their eyes decreases, thus, decreasing the possibilities of interaction through eye gaze. The biomechanics model used here can be further extended to study muscular activity of eye muscles during immersion. It presents an efficient and flexible assessment tool for virtual environments.","Virtual reality, Eye vergence movement, Eye tracking, Biomechanical simulation, Extraocular muscles",Julie Iskander and Mohammed Hossny and Saeid Nahavandi,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018302904,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102883,0003-6870,2019,102883,81,Applied Ergonomics,Using biomechanics to investigate the effect of VR on eye vergence system,article,ISKANDER2019102883
"Distractors have been shown to adversely impact individuals' ability to acquire target information. However, not all distractors are the same. Distractors that compete/interfere for the same cognitive resources as the target, are thought to be more detrimental to performance than those that do not compete for the same resources. The aim of the present research was to examine the effect of distractors on individuals' memory, namely recall of key safety messages presented in an airline's pre-flight safety briefing. In a laboratory experiment in which one-hundred and twenty-four participants watched one of four different videos, two of which were paired with a distractor task (grammatical reason and computation task), we identified the adverse effect of the distractor task on recall performance. Minor differences were noted between the two distractor task groups. These results suggest the effect of a distractor on performance may be explained, in general by the additional cognitive load imposed, as opposed to the more specific competition for the same cognitive resources. From an applied perspective, these results highlight the importance of limiting distractors when important information to be remembered is communicated.","Distraction, Attention, Cabin safety",Brett R.C.

"Police working in active duty have a high prevalence of musculoskeletal pain, with lower back pain being the most frequently reported. As a part of uniform regulations, Swedish police are mandated to wear body armour and duty belts at all times during work. This study aimed to investigate the effect of different load carriage designs on invehicle sitting pressure and self-rated discomfort among police. Results showed less discomfort when wearing the alternate load carriage system incorporating a load-bearing vest and thigh holster compared to the standard load carriage system consisting of a duty belt. Pressures in the lower back were reduced when wearing the load-bearing vest whereas pressures in the upper back region increased. Relocating appointments away from the waist has the potential to improve sitting positions and the ergonomic situation for police when driving fleet vehicles.","Driving, Law enforcement, Lower back, Occupational health, Protective equipment",Louise BÃ¦k Larsen and Nerrolyn Ramstrand and Roy Tranberg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300973,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.05.017,0003-6870,2019,146--151,80,Applied Ergonomics,Duty belt or load-bearing vest?

"A web-based survey was conducted of ergonomics practitioners holding certifications in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. The survey follows 12 years after an earlier initial survey reported by Dempsey et al. (2005). Approximately 1221 eligible participants were invited by e-mail to participate, and 405 surveys were included in the final analysis. The survey queried use of basic instruments relevant to ergonomic practice as well as more specific analytical tools such as observational techniques for assessing postural demands of work and instrumentation for direct measurement of such demands. Some ergonomic assessment methods appear to have increased in their overall use by U.S. ergonomists compared to 2005 data. This was observed for: RULA, REBA, Psychophysical Upper Extremity Data, Strain Index, and ACGIH TLV for Hand Activity Level. There is minimal evidence of increased overall use of direct measurement approaches in the U.S. There appear to be geographic differences between countries/continents in terms of use of various methods. The use of mobile device/smart phone â??appsâ? by ergonomists was queried and these technologies presently appear to be in early adoption phase with 24â??28% of practitioners reporting use of an app in their ergonomics practice.","Ergonomics, Musculoskeletal disorders, Certification",Brian D.

"The current study evaluated the validity of commercially available electroencephalography (EEG) cognitive state metrics of workload and engagement in differentially experienced air traffic control (ATC) students. EEG and pupil diameter recordings were collected from 47 ATC students (27 more experienced and 20 less experienced) during a high-fidelity, variable workload approach-control scenario. Scenario workload was manipulated by increasing the number of aircraft released and the presence of a divided attention task. Results showed that scenario performance significantly degraded with increased aircraft and the presence of the divided attention task. No scenario performance differences were found between experience groups. The EEG engagement metric significantly differed between experience groups, with less experienced controllers exhibiting higher engagement than more experienced controllers. The EEG workload metric and pupil diameter were sensitive to workload manipulations but did not differentiate experience groups. Commercially available EEG cognitive state metrics may be a viable tool for enhancing ATC training.","Air traffic control, Cognitive state monitoring, Electroencephalography, Operator experience",Kyle A.

"Care managers who coordinate care for chronically ill patients in hospitals and outpatient settings use multiple health information technologies for accessing, processing, documenting, and communicating patient-related information. Using a combination of 41 interviews and observations of 15 care managers, we identified a range of technology-related barriers experienced by care managers (total of 163 occurrences). The barriers are related to (lack of) access to information, inadequate information, limited usefulness and usability of the technologies, challenges associated with using multiple health IT, and technical problems. In 43% of the occurrences, care managers describe strategies to deal with the technology barriers; these fit in three categories: nothing/delay (9 occurrences), work-arounds (32 occurrences), and direct action at the individual, team, and organization levels (29 occurrences). Our data show the adaptive capacity of care managers who develop various strategies to deal with technology barriers and are, therefore, able to care for chronically ill patients. This information can be used as input to work system redesigns.","Work system, Barriers, Strategies, Adaptation, Care manager, Care coordination, Health information technology, Usability",Pascale Carayon and Ann Schoofs Hundt and Peter Hoonakker,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300614,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.03.009,0003-6870,2019,240--247,78,Applied Ergonomics,Technology barriers and strategies in coordinating care for chronically ill patients,article,CARAYON2019240
"Activity-based Flexible Offices (AFOs) are innovations in workspace design that have been increasingly implemented in organisations in recent years. There are conflicting research results on the long-term consequences of implementing AFOs. This paper investigates the changes (if any) that occur over time, in: 1) employee satisfaction with AFO solutions and perceived work support, 2) ways of working and using AFOs and 3) the AFO solution. Two organisations participated in the study. The data collection involved: (i) semi-structured interviews with 26 employees and (ii) process enquiries involving the collection of secondary data and interviews with facility management teams. The findings indicate that limited options for improving an AFO solution lead to lingering work environment problems. By contrast, modifying the solution through systematic processes based on employee feedback helped resolving the initial problems. Over time, this led to an increased appreciation and a sense of collective ownership of the AFO solution.","Activity-based working (ABW), Work environment, Occupational health and safety (OHS)",Maral Babapour,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018304782,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102877,0003-6870,2019,102877,81,Applied Ergonomics,"From fading novelty effects to emergent appreciation of Activity-based Flexible Offices: Comparing the individual, organisational and spatial adaptations in two case organisations",article,BABAPOUR2019102877
"Care coordination is important for chronically ill patients who need assistance from a variety of healthcare professionals especially when they transition through different care settings. There has not been a clear definition of care coordination and its associated activities. This paper provides a two-dimension framework of care coordination for chronically ill patients: 1) coordination activities (i.e. communication and monitoring) and 2) interdependencies (i.e. flow, shared resources, simultaneity). We used this framework in a qualitative content analysis of 12 interviews with healthcare professionals involved in coordinating care of chronically ill patients. We identified a total of 258 care coordination activities and developed categories and sub-categories using the constant comparative method. The first category of care coordination activities involves communication with flow or shared resources interdependencies or both. This category includes arranging services and equipment for the patient, exchanging information about patient transition to different care settings, reporting errors and resolving them, and helping the patient with appointments and transportation. The second category involves monitoring, sometimes combined with communication, with flow or shared resources interdependencies or both. This category includes reviewing medications and services and detecting errors, reviewing patient symptoms and following up if needed, and scheduling follow-up to review patient status. The last category involves communication with simultaneity interdependency. This category involves talking in the same location and developing a plan of care, people exchanging information at the same time, and scheduling delivery of medications/services to correspond with patient arrival home. Finally, we identified characteristics of health information technology that can support these various care coordination activities.","Care coordination, Coordination activity, Interdependency, Chronically ill patients, Patient journey, Health information technology",Sarah Kianfar and Pascale Carayon and Ann Schoofs Hundt and Peter Hoonakker,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018306045,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.05.002,0003-6870,2019,9--16,80,Applied Ergonomics,Care coordination for chronically ill patients: Identifying coordination activities and interdependencies,article,KIANFAR20199

"This study examined the effects of display curvature and task duration on proofreading performance, visual discomfort, visual fatigue, mental workload, and user satisfaction. Five 27â?³ rear-screen mock-ups with distinct curvature radii (600R, 1140R, 2000R, 4000R, and flat) were used. Ten individuals per display curvature completed a series of four 15â?¯min comparison-proofreading trials at a 600â?¯mm viewing distance. Only proofreading speed benefited from display curvature, with 600R providing the highest mean proofreading speed. Proofreading speed increased and accuracy decreased for all display curvatures over the 1â?¯h proofreading period. Visual discomfort, visual fatigue, and mental workload increased during the first 15â?¯min of proofreading. A decrease in critical fusion frequency during that period indicated increases in visual fatigue and mental workload.

"Establishing the best layout configuration for software-generated interfaces and control panels is a complex problem when they include many controls and indicators. Several methods have been developed for arranging the interface elements; however, the results are usually conceptual designs that must be manually adjusted to obtain layouts valid for real situations. Based on these considerations, in this work we propose a new automatized procedure to obtain optimal layouts for software-based interfaces. Eye-tracking and mouse-tracking data collected during the use of the interface is used to obtain the best configuration for its elements. The solutions are generated using a slicing-trees based genetic algorithm. This algorithm is able to obtain really applicable configurations that respect the geometrical restrictions of elements in the interface. Results show that this procedure increases effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction of the users when they interact with the obtained interfaces.","Interfaces, Layout, Eye-tracking, Genetic algorithms",Jose Antonio Diego-Mas and Diana Garzon-Leal and Rocio Poveda-Bautista and Jorge Alcaide-Marzal,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300572,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.03.004,0003-6870,2019,197--209,78,Applied Ergonomics,"User-interfaces layout optimization using eye-tracking, mouse movements and genetic algorithms",article,DIEGOMAS2019197
"The effects on dehydration and cognitive performance from heat and/or physical activity are well established in the laboratory, although have not yet been studied for personnel working in occupations such as wildland firefighting regularly exposed to these types of conditions.

"This paper seeks to elicit and structure the factors that shape the execution and, in particular, the coordination of work in Out of Hours care. Evenings and weekends in UK hospitals are managed by specific Out of Hours (OoH) care arrangements, and associated technology. Managing care within the constraints of staff availability and demands is a key concern for both patient care and staff wellbeing, yet has received little attention from healthcare human factors. A study of sixteen clinical staff used Critical Decision Method to understand how work is coordinated and the constraints and criteria that are applied by the roles managing OoH care. The analysis identified ten types of coordination decision that, in turn, underpinned three types of adaptive behaviour â?? pre-emption, information augmentation and self-organisation â?? that were crucial for the effective performance in OoH care. These behaviours explain how OoH staff manage the task demands placed on them, individually and as a team.","Out of Hours care, Healthcare, Coordination, Complex systems, Workload management",Sarah Martindale and David Golightly and James Pinchin and Dominick Shaw and John Blakey and Iker Perez and Sarah Sharples,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701930095X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.05.011,0003-6870,2019,102861,81,Applied Ergonomics,An interview analysis of coordination behaviours in Outâ??ofâ??Hours secondary care,article,MARTINDALE2019102861

"Target visual salience and biological motion independently influence the accuracy and latency of observer detection. However, it is currently unknown how these target parameters might interact in modulating the detectability of camouflaged human targets. In two experiments, observers performed a visual target detection task. In a pilot experiment, observers detected a static human target with parametrically varied visual salience, superimposed on a complex background scene. As expected, results demonstrated varied target detectability as a function of salience, with observers showing higher hit rates and faster response times as a function of increased salience. In the Main Experiment, observers detected simulated human targets walking across a complex scene at five different speeds and three different levels of visual salience (as validated in the pilot experiment). We found strong effects of both movement rate and visual salience, and the two parameters interacted. Specifically, increasing the rate of biological motion increased detectability for even the least salient camouflage patterns. In other words, biological motion can â??breakâ? even the least conspicuous camouflage pattern. In contrast, a very salient pattern was highly detectable under static and moving conditions. Results are considered in relation to theories of camouflage detectability, and trade-offs between camouflage development efforts versus advanced training in military maneuvering.","Camouflage, Visual salience, Biological motion, Visual perception",Tad T.

"During validation of power tools, one objective is to determine the usability of the device for several applications. A common way to gain this user knowledge is to carry out tests under laboratory conditions with non-professional craftsmen, whereby a non-professional user does not work and evaluate a power tool similarly to a professional. Therefore an experimental study was conducted to investigate the possibility of training non-professionals in the professional working methods and evaluation of relevant key criteria for drywall screwdrivers. 39 subjects were divided into three groups and trained in the professional use of a drywall screwdriver. Results indicate that targeted training significantly improves the professional way of working (professional hand position p = 0.000, Î² = -0.764) and evaluation (testing of mass distribution p = 0.000, Î² = -0.731) of a drywall screwdriver.

"Work involving extensive pushing and pulling is associated with higher frequency of shoulder complaints. While reports of shoulder muscle demand during submaximal isometric tasks are abundant, dynamic submaximal push-pull exertions are not well understood. We evaluated how muscle demand (weighted EMG average) of surface glenohumeral muscles varies with task type and target. Seventeen healthy young adults performed seated unimanual and bimanual pushes and pulls to 3 thoracohumeral elevations (20Â°, 90Â°, 170Â°) and 4 elevation planes (0Â°, 45Â°, 90Â°, 135Â°) with loading at 15% of isometric push-pull capacity. Pulling required less demand than pushing (pâ?¯<â?¯0.0001). Muscle demand varied more with elevation than elevation plane. The lowest target had highest demand for pulling (pâ?¯<â?¯0.01), and the most elevated target had highest demand for pushing (pâ?¯<â?¯0.0001). Working above the shoulder is known to increase demand during isometric tasks, however, these results suggest that for dynamic tasks working against gravity has a larger effect on demand than task target.","Upper limb, Shoulder, Electromyography",Daniel C.

The focus of this study was on the possibility of implementing an office ergonomics programme as part of a broader workplace health initiative at a South African research organisation. We explored the perspectives of actors in the workplace regarding organisational barriers and facilitators to implementing ergonomic interventions. This qualitative study presents the perspectives of three workplace actor groups: operational managers (nâ?¯=â?¯4); health and safety representatives (nâ?¯=â?¯9); and office employees (nâ?¯=â?¯4) who were involved in a previous ergonomic assessments that proposed several corrective and preventive actions. Eight factors emerged as either barriers or as simultaneous barriers and facilitators to the implementation of proposed ergonomic interventions. These are: organisational culture; information and specialist support; funding; support from operational managers; attitude towards changes; general organisational awareness; individual knowledge of ergonomics; and support from colleagues.

"With a scarcity of research on multiple working arrangements, the aim of the paper is to contribute empirical data from a Norwegian engineering, procurement, and construction enterprise that shed light on the challenges and benefits of a 14â??21 working arrangement in itself and in relation to other working arrangements. We combine a sociotechnical system perspective with systematic content analysis using QSR NVivo, which reveals organizational complexity comprised of indirect, direct, positive, negative, and mutual interplays between various aspects of the enterprise, including processes and outcomes. We find that the 14â??21 working arrangement, in combination with other factors of the work system, sets the premises for work processes and outcome factors that are both beneficial and challenging to individuals and the organization. We also find that work process factors, such as work and information flow as well as follow-up and facilitation, depend on the presence of, and dynamic coordination and communication among, individuals across the organization. This in turn requires a support network, work groups, and supervisors to be on the same working arrangement.","SEIPS, STS, Organizational complexity, EPC industry, Multiple working arrangements",Sindre Aske HÃ¸yland and Kari Anne Holte and Leif Jarle GressgÃ¥rd and KÃ¥re Hansen and Astrid Solberg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018307300,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.12.005,0003-6870,2019,73--81,76,Applied Ergonomics,"Exploring multiple working arrangements in Norwegian engineering, procurement, and construction industry from a middle manager and supervisor perspective: A sociotechnical system perspective",article,HOYLAND201973
"Standing is a popular alternative to traditionally seated computer work. However, no studies have described how standing impacts both upper body muscular and vascular outcomes during a computer typing task. Twenty healthy adults completed two 90-min simulated work sessions, seated or standing. Upper limb discomfort, electromyography (EMG) from eight upper body muscles, typing performance and neck/shoulder and forearm blood flow were collected. Results showed significantly less upper body discomfort and higher typing speed during standing. Lower Trapezius EMG amplitude was higher during standing, but this postural difference decreased with time (interaction effect), and its variability was 68% higher during standing compared to sitting. There were no effects on blood flow. Results suggest that standing computer work may engage shoulder girdle stabilizers while reducing discomfort and improving performance.

Ten healthy right-handed subjects performed 13 activities of daily living (ADL) with normal products and 22 ADs and both arm (shoulder, elbow and wrist) and hand (grasp types and contacts) postures were analysed. ADs were found to affect upper limb postures in ADL, reducing the use of precision grasps in the right hand by 31.9% and increasing palm contact by 26% and 29.1% in right and left hands, respectively. Nevertheless, they were also found to increase shoulder flexion, elbow pronation and wrist deviation, which may be a drawback in some pathologies. Results may help in the selection of a suitable AD for enhancing ADL performance depending on the patient's limitations due to a particular pathology.","Assistive device, Activities of daily living, Upper limb posture, Grasp classification",Alba Roda-Sales and Margarita Vergara and JoaquÃ­n L.

"The so-called â??fatal fiveâ?? behaviours (drink and drug driving, distraction and inattention, speeding, fatigue, and failure to wear a seat belt) are known to be the major behavioural contributory factors to road trauma. However, little is known about the factors that lead to drivers engaging in each behaviour. This article presents the findings from a study which collected and analysed data on the factors that lead to drivers engaging in each behaviour. The study involved a survey of drivers' perceptions of the causes of each behaviour and a subject matter expert workshop to gain the views of road safety experts. The results were mapped onto a systems ergonomics model of the road transport system in Queensland, Australia, to show where in the system the factors reside. In addition to well-known factors relating to drivers' knowledge, experience and personality, additional factors at the higher levels of the road transport system related to road safety policy, transport system design, road rules and regulations, and societal issues were identified. It is concluded that the fatal five behaviours have a web of interacting contributory factors underpinning them and are systems problems rather than driver-centric problems. The implications for road safety interventions are discussed.","Road safety, Systems ergonomics, STAMP, Fatal five",Paul M. Salmon and Gemma J.M.

"Research has shown that older adults interact with products less intuitively than younger adults, and that familiarity is an essential element of intuitive interaction. This paper reports on the findings of two empirical studies that examined familiarity in younger and older adults. Each study comprised 32 participants over four age groups. The first study required participants to use their own contemporary products in their homes in order to investigate older adults' familiarity with them, and how this familiarity differed from that of younger adults. Older people were less familiar with their own contemporary products that younger people. The second study aimed to investigate differences in familiarity between younger and older adults while using products that they did not own and were likely to be less familiar with. When using products not already familiar to them, both middle aged and older adults showed significantly lower familiarity than younger people. The significance of this research is in its empirical findings about familiarity differences between age groups. It has been recognised that the identification and understanding of differences in familiarity will enable designers to design more intuitive interfaces and systems for both younger and older cohorts. The implications of the findings from the two studies reported here are discussed in light of this recognition.","Human computer interaction, User knowledge, Familiarity, Intuitive interaction, Interface design",Simon Lawry and Vesna Popovic and Alethea Blackler and Helen Thompson,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018302898,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.08.016,0003-6870,2019,74--84,74,Applied Ergonomics,"Age, familiarity, and intuitive use: An empirical investigation",article,LAWRY201974
"This study examined complex terrain march performance and cardiorespiratory responses when carrying different Soldier loads. Nine active duty military personnel (age, 21 Â± 3 yr; height, 1.72 Â± 0.07 m; body mass (BM), 83.4 Â± 12.9 kg) attended two test visits during which they completed consecutive laps around a 2.5-km mixed terrain course with either a fighting load (30% BM) or an approach load (45% BM). Respiratory rate and heart rate data were collected using physiological status monitors. Training impulse (TRIMP) scores were calculated using Banister's formula to provide an integrated measure of both time and cardiorespiratory demands. Completion times were not significantly different between the fighting and approach loads for either Lap 1 (p = 0.38) or Lap 2 (p = 0.09). Respiration rate was not significantly higher with the approach load than the fighting load during Lap 1 (p = 0.17) but was significantly higher for Lap 2 (p = 0.04). However, heart rate was significantly higher with the approach load versus the fighting load during both Lap 1 (p = 0.03) and Lap 2 (p = 0.04). Furthermore, TRIMP was significantly greater with the approach load versus the fighting load during both Lap 1 (p = 0.02) and Lap 2 (p = 0.02). Trained military personnel can maintain similar pacing while carrying either fighting or approach loads during short mixed terrain marches. However, cardiorespiratory demands are greatly elevated with the approach load and will likely continue to rise during longer distance marches.","Load carriage, Military, Heart rate",David P.

"Load carriage induces systematic alterations in gait patterns and pelvic-thoracic coordination. Leveraging this information, the objective of this study was to develop and assess a statistical prediction algorithm that uses body-worn inertial sensor data for classifying load carrying modes and load levels. Nine men participated in an experiment carrying a hand load in four modes: one-handed right and left carry, and two-handed side and anterior carry, each at 50% and 75% of the participant's maximum acceptable weight of carry, and a no-load reference condition. Twelve gait parameters calculated from inertial sensor data for each gait cycle, including gait phase durations, torso and pelvis postural sway, and thoracic-pelvic coordination were used as predictors in a two-stage hierarchical random forest classification model with Bayesian inference. The model correctly classified 96.9% of the carrying modes and 93.1% of the load levels. Coronal thoracic-pelvic coordination and pelvis postural sway were the most relevant predictors although their relative importance differed between carrying mode and load level prediction models. This study presents an algorithmic framework for combining inertial sensing with statistical prediction with potential use for quantifying physical exposures from load carriage.","Load carriage, Inertial sensors, Load classification, Gait kinematics",Sol Lim and Clive D'Souza,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018306690,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.11.007,0003-6870,2019,1--11,76,Applied Ergonomics,Statistical prediction of load carriage mode and magnitude from inertial sensor derived gait kinematics,article,LIM20191
"Background Predicting the energy costs of human travel over snow can be of significant value to the military and other agencies planning work efforts when snow is present. The ability to quantify, and predict, those costs can help planners determine if snow will be a factor in the execution of dismounted tasks and operations. To adjust predictive models for the effect of terrain, and more specifically for surface conditions, on energy costs, terrain coefficients (Æ?) have been developed. The physiological demands of foot travel over snow have been studied previously, and there are well established methods of predicting metabolic costs of locomotion. By applying knowledge gained from prior studies of the effects of terrain and snow, and by leveraging those existing dismounted locomotion models, this paper seeks to outline the steps in developing an improved terrain coefficient (Æ?) for snow to be used in predictive modeling. Methods Using published data, methods, and a well-informed understanding of the physical elements of terrain, e.g., characterization of snow sinkage (z), this study made adjustments to Æ?-values specific to snow. Results This review of published metabolic cost methods suggest that an improved Æ?-value could be developed for use with the Pandolf equation, where zâ?¯=â?¯depth (h)*(1 - (snow density (Ï0)/1.186)) and Æ?â?¯=â?¯0.0005z3Â +Â 0.0001z2Â +Â 0.1072zÂ +Â 1.2604. Conclusion While the complexity of variables related to characteristics of snow, speed of movement, and individuals confound efforts to develop a simple, predictive model, this paper provides data-driven improvements to models that are used to predict the energy costs of dismounted movements over snow.","Metabolic costs, Physiology, Military, Load carriage",Paul W.

"A prediction model is used to predict subjective responses of crane operators with respect to different designs of In-Vehicle Visual Support (IVVS). Selected gaze metrics are used as objective metrics to minimize prejudice, which is commonly caused by subjective measures. Experiments are carried out using crane simulator to measure glance behavior of novice operators and the 3D perspective projection method is used for autonomous mapping of gaze fixations to dynamic Area-of-Interests (AOIs). Subjective responses, such as operators' emotion and usability of IVVS, are evaluated using the Likert scale of the Semantic Differential method. Correlation between gaze metrics and subjective responses is established using multiple linear regression. Glance behavior exhibits a statistically significant difference when information on IVVS is perceived as useful to ease operation and reduce tension. Despite this, there are no significant signs of distraction. Glance behavior is found to be a reliable sub-conscious indicator of subjective response and distraction. More importantly, the proposed gaze metrics are found to be a good representation of glance behavior, such as randomness and distribution of attention. The methods and findings are useful to evaluate impact of IVVS, which is becoming more common in many other applications.","Gaze metrics, Dynamic area-of-interests, In-vehicle visual support system (IVVS), Operator distraction, Subjective response, Crane operation",Jouh Yeong Chew and Koichi Ohtomi and Hiromasa Suzuki,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018301959,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.07.005,0003-6870,2018,183--193,73,Applied Ergonomics,Glance behavior as design indices of in-vehicle visual support system: A study using crane simulators,article,CHEW2018183
"Several innovative measures in traffic control applied in Europe have successfully improved the comfort and safety of cycling, among which is the green waves for cyclists. Consecutive traffic lights are synchronised to create a green wave, increasing comfort and decreasing waiting times and related deliberate red-light running. This study focused on exploring the user acceptance of green wave systems and the user evaluation of six distinct interface designs (i.e. numeric-based countdown, dot-based vertical countdown, dot-based clockwise countdown, LED line, LED road surface, on-bike speed indicator). Results indicate a preference for three systems: numeric-based countdown, LED line and LED road surface. Results also show a significant influence of nationality on the evaluation of the interfaces. Based on our findings, we argue that the numeric-based countdown represents the most promising option for future adaptive green wave implementations. The outcomes of the present study represent a useful evidence and guidance for researchers, designers and decision makers in the field of green waves, mobility and traffic safety.","Green wave, User acceptance, User interface design",Marco {De Angelis} and Arjan Stuiver and Federico Fraboni and Gabriele Prati and VÃ­ctor MarÃ­n Puchades and Filippo Fassina and Dick {de Waard} and Luca Pietrantoni,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018307385,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.12.008,0003-6870,2019,113--121,76,Applied Ergonomics,Green wave for cyclists: Usersâ?? perception and preferences,article,DEANGELIS2019113
"Simulations offer the benefits of a safer and more accessible learning environment, where learners can practice until the point of proficiency. While research into the effectiveness of simulations as learning tools has found tangible benefits, fewer studies have examined retention and differences between high and low fidelity simulations. This research sought to supplement the literature in this domain by investigating whether participants who learned to construct an electrical circuit using a 2D or 3D breadboard simulation could achieve comparable learning, transfer, and retention outcomes to those who learned using a physical breadboard. The influence of learner characteristics - cognitive ability and goal orientation - were also evaluated. This study had two parts: a cross-sectional portion that examined learning and transfer outcomes and a longitudinal portion that examined retention outcomes after a 2 and 4-week period. The cross-sectional analysis included 70 participants and the longitudinal analysis included 40 participants. The results found that the physical fidelity of the learning environment significantly impacted several transfer outcomes (construction and construction time) but not retention outcomes. Cognitive ability was a significant predictor of learning (gain score, circuit design score) and retention (posttest scores, construction time) outcomes. Learning goal orientation significantly predicted circuit construction over time and measurement occasion significantly predicted posttest scores and interacted with fidelity to predict circuit design score. The study demonstrated that simulated environments can lead to comparable, or better, proficiency than physical environments. These findings have implications for the design and implementation of simulated environments, specifically for courses delivered in an online setting.","Simulation, Learning, Fidelity",Myrtede C.

"This paper focuses on the comparative assessment of comfort and discomfort (hereafter, (dis-)comfort) for aircraft seating. Subjective and objective data of seating (dis-)comfort were collected during an experiment involving 20 volunteers who tested 3 aircraft double-seats in upright and reclined position. In order to minimize experimental uncertainty due to well-known noise factors (i.e. patterns of discomfort during the work week and during the work day, order of evaluation, inter-individual differences), experimental trials were performed according to a crossover design. Statistical data analysis aimed mainly at investigating (dis-)comfort differences across seat conditions; gender-based differences in perceived discomfort on different body parts; effect of sitting duration on perceived discomfort on different body parts. The experimental results show that differences across seat conditions impacted differently on perceived discomfort depending on gender, body parts and sitting duration. No significant differences in perceived discomfort across gender were evident for the lightweight seat in both upright and reclined positions. On the contrary, for both baseline configurations, perceived discomfort at head and neck areas was higher for males than for females. For all seat conditions, participants experienced a significant worsening of perceived comfort over time at shoulders, back, sacrum and thighs and, in addition, at upper body area (i.e. neck, arm and forearm) and knees only for seats in reclined position.","Aircraft seat, Seating discomfort, Seating comfort, Discomfort index",Amalia Vanacore and Antonio Lanzotti and Chiara Percuoco and Agostino Capasso and Bonaventura Vitolo,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018307439,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.12.012,0003-6870,2019,155--163,76,Applied Ergonomics,Design and analysis of comparative experiments to assess the (dis-)comfort of aircraft seating,article,VANACORE2019155
"Introduction Repetitive movements and awkward postures are two persistent injury risk factors for grocery store cashiers. Due to the recent rise in popularity of environmentally-friendly grocery bagging options, current recommendations for cashiers are likely outdated. Correspondingly, the objective of this study was to examine the effects of cashier-specific work demands, workstation configuration, and container type on upper limb postures during typical job activities. Methods Fifteen experienced cashiers bagged groceries at varying combinations of workstation height (low, medium, high) and container type (reusable bins, reusable bags, plastic bags). Upper limb movement was quantified with motion capture and amplitude probability distribution functions of humeral elevation and humeral axial internal rotation were used to assess the static (10th percentile), median (50th percentile), and peak (90th percentile) postural demands, which were then interpreted in the context of existing postural guidelines. Results High workstation height and reusable bags increased right arm elevation at peak posture by 15.7Â° compared to the low workstation height and reusable bin combination. However, reusable bins increased internal rotation demands of the right arm by 4.3Â° compared to other container types. Left arm elevation and internal rotation were consistently lower than right arm angles. Conclusion Cashiers are encouraged to adjust the workstation to decrease the arm elevation and internal rotation required by higher workstation heights and tall containers, and to use both arms for scanning and packing, when possible, to reduce undesirable arm postures.","Upper limb posture, Cashier, Ergonomics, Shoulder, Kinematics",Angelica E.

"Well-designed handrails significantly enhance balance recovery, by allowing users to apply high forces to the rail and stabilize their center of mass. However, data on user-applied handrail forces during balance recovery are limited. We characterized the peak forces that 50 young adults applied to a handrail during forward and backward falling motions; quantified effects of handrail height (34, 38, 42 inches) and position prior to balance loss (standing beside the rail with or without hand contact, or facing the handrail with two-handed contact); and examined the relationship between handrail forces and individual mass. The testing environment consisted of a robotic platform that translated rapidly to destabilize participants, and a height-adjustable handrail that was mounted to the platform. Our findings support our hypotheses that starting position and handrail height significantly affect peak handrail forces in most axes. The highest handrail forces were applied when participants faced the handrail and grasped with two hands. In these cases, increased handrail height was associated with increased anterior forces and decreased downward, upward and resultant forces. As hypothesized, peak handrail forces correlated strongly with individual weight in most axes. Implications of these findings for handrail design are discussed.","Balance recovery, Kinetics, Handrail design",Vicki Komisar and Konika Nirmalanathan and Emily C. King and Brian E.

"Objective To examine the role of cross-task cue utilisation in the acquisition of situational awareness during the initial stages of learning to operate an air traffic control simulation. Background Cue-based associations are an important component of situational awareness, a construct that is necessary for skilled process control, where the location, movement, and direction of multiple targets needs to be managed. However, the potential for high levels of situational awareness is difficult to assess in the absence of exposure. Previous research suggests that cross-task cue utilisation predicts the acquisition of feature-event associations that form the basis of situational awareness Method Sixty university students undertook an assessment of cue utilisation in the context of motor vehicle driving and subsequently engaged in an air traffic control simulation task. During the air traffic control simulation task, situational awareness queries were introduced based on the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Test (SAGAT). Results The analyses revealed that participants who demonstrated relatively higher levels of cross-task cue utilisation also demonstrated greater performance on the SAGAT and achieved greater performance during the simulated air traffic control task. Conclusion The outcomes suggest a relationship between cross-task cue utilisation and situational awareness, particularly at the initial stages of skill acquisition. Application Assessments of cross-task cue utilisation may be used to distinguish the propensity for prospective trainees to acquire the situational awareness necessary for complex, process control tasks such as air traffic control.","Cross-task cue utilisation, Situational awareness, Skill acquisition",Emma C.

"The risk of back injury during work remains high today for manual materials handler. The purpose of this study is to identify the potential presence of compensatory strategies in obese and non-obese handlers and evaluate the impact these strategies have on trunk kinematics and kinetics. The biomechanical and ergonomic impacts in 17 obese and 20 healthy-weight handlers were evaluated. The task studied consisted in moving boxes from a conveyor to a hand trolley and back. The results show that the anthropometric characteristics of obese handlers are linked to a significant increase in peak lumbar loading during lifting and lowering of boxes. Few postural differences between the two groups were observed. These results suggest that the excess weight of an obese worker has a significant added effect on the musculoskeletal structures of the back, which exposes obese handlers to a higher risk of developing a musculoskeletal disorder during load handling.","Body weight, Lifting, Lowering, External loading, Lumbar moment, L5/S1 joint, Spinal loading, Obesity",Philippe Corbeil and AndrÃ© Plamondon and Grant Handrigan and Jasmin VallÃ©e-Marcotte and Simon Laurendeau and Jasmin {Ten Have} and Nancy Manzerolle,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018303077,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.08.018,0003-6870,2019,124--133,74,Applied Ergonomics,Biomechanical analysis of manual material handling movement in healthy weight and obese workers,article,CORBEIL2019124
"Advanced minimally invasive procedures may cause postural constraints and increased workload and stress for providers. This study compared workload and stress across surgical team roles for 48 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (4-port vs single-port) using a task load index (NASA-TLX), a procedural difficulty question, and salivary stress hormones. Statistical analyses were performed based on the presence intra-cluster correlation within team roles, at Î±=0.05. The single-port technique resulted in an 89% increase in physical workload for the surgeon and 63% increase for the assistant (both p<0.05). The surgeon had significantly higher salivary stress hormones during single-port surgeries. The degree of procedural difficulty was positively correlated between the surgeon and most roles: resident (r=0.67), assistant (r=0.81), and technician (r=0.81). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the surgeon and assistant for all selfreported workload measures (p<0.05).

"This study aimed to extract information from body pressure distribution, including comfort, participant body size, and seat characteristics by using supervised deep learning, and body pressure characteristics corresponding to sensory evaluation by using unsupervised deep learning. Body pressure data of 18 participants and 19 kinds of car seats were used for the analysis. Sensory evaluation of 9 items concerning cushion characteristics and seat comfort was conducted. From the analysis, we determined that body size and car seats could be classified with high precision by using body pressure distribution data. For the sensory evaluation items, the correct answer rate was high. By examining the importance of the cells of the mat, the features of the body pressure mat at the seat cushion and backrest, body size, car seat, and parts related to sensory evaluation could be determined in detail.

"This study tested whether adverse effects of state anxiety on attention and performance may be modulated by experience. Sixteen experienced and eleven inexperienced drivers drove in a simulator under low- and high-stress conditions. Anxiety was manipulated by competition, the presence of an evaluator, external video camera, and traffic noise. Most drivers showed greater anxiety scores and higher mean heart rates following manipulation. In both groups increased state anxiety decreased car speed control and caused more collisions, accompanied by fewer fixations of longer duration towards the driving lane across a horizontally narrower region. Inexperienced drivers increased the number of short fixations towards cars, while experienced drivers increased the number of short fixations on the speedometer. Although anxiety impairs processing efficiency and performance effectiveness for both groups, attentional changes differ as a function of experience. Inexperienced drivers tended to shift attention to threatening stimuli, while experienced drives were more likely to consciously monitor task goal.","Anxiety, Driving experience, Gaze, Attentional control theory",Gisele C.

"Nursing is a physically demanding job characterized by a high prevalence of fatigue and musculoskeletal disorders. One of the high-exertion and repetitive nursing tasks is the manual connection of an infusion set to a medical fluid bottle. Such physical work can be eased by the design of new hand tools. Correspondingly, this study designed and ergonomically assessed an infusion set connector tool (ISCT) and compared it with that of manual connection. First, a prototype of ISCT was designed to perform infusion set connecting task in the mechanical form. Subsequently, 12 nurses were asked to connect an infusion set to medical bottle in the form of manual and mechanical tasks and these tasks were evaluated using ergonomic indices including muscular activity level, force, posture, and subjective (Borg scale CR10) measures. Results showed that the activity levels (root mean square) of the extensor digitorum communis, flexor carpi radialis, biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles remarkably decreased when the nurses used the ISCT. The postures of the wrist, arm, and shoulder regions were corrected from Rapid Upper Limb Assessment action level 3 to 2 when the designed tool was used. Additionally, the subjective perception of exertion was significantly lower with the use of the prototype.","Ergonomic design, Infusion set, Nursing",Ehsan Garosi and Adel Mazloumi and Reza Kalantari and Zahra Vahedi and Zahra Shirzhiyan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018303879,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.09.008,0003-6870,2019,91--98,75,Applied Ergonomics,Design and ergonomic assessment of an infusion set connector tool used in nursing work,article,GAROSI201991
"During collaborative problem solving (CPS), coordination occurs at different spatial and temporal scales. This multiscale coordination should play a functional role in facilitating effective collaboration. To evaluate this, we conducted a study of computer-based CPS with 42 dyadic teams. We used cross-wavelet coherence to examine movement coordination, extracted from videos, at several scales, and tested whether the observed coordination was greater than expected due to chance and due to task demands. We found that coordination at scales less than 2s was greater than chance and at most scales (except 16s, 1m, and 2m), was greater than expected due to task demands. Lastly, we observed that coherence at .25s and 1s scales was predictive of performance. However, when including relative phase, our results suggest that higher in-phase movement coordination at the 1s scale was the strongest predictor of CPS performance. Further, we used growth curve modeling to examine how movement coordination changes across the duration of the task and whether this is moderated by CPS performance. We found that coordination over the duration of the CPS task is quadratic (a U shape) and that better performing teams have higher coordination with a shallower curve. We discuss these findings and their relevance to understanding how low-level movement coordination facilitates CPS.","Coordination, Collaboration, Problem solving, Team performance, Dynamical systems, Synchrony",Travis J.

"This study proposes an ingress/egress discomfort prediction algorithm using an in-depth biomechanical method and motion capture database. The ingress/egress motion of the subject was captured using an optical motion capture system and physically adjustable vehicle mock-up. The subjective discomfort evaluation data were also recorded at the same time. The inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics were performed to analyze captured ingress/egress motion. These procedure provide motion and joint torque information on each subject. Based on the analysis results, this study proposes the following novel features: accumulated movement of joint and sum of rectified joint torque. This study conducted a feature selection procedure to identify a relevant feature subset. Recursive feature selection and optimal feature selection methods found the most relevant feature subset with collected subjective responses. Finally, we constructed the prediction model using support vector machine. The prediction model was evaluated through prediction accuracy and statistical analysis. For comparison with the previous study, this study implemented two representative models and compare the result with those of the previous studies using the identical dataset. The effectiveness of proposed algorithm was demonstrated in comparison with previous studies.","Ingress/egress, Biomechanics, Discomfort, Motion analysis, Feature selection",Younguk Kim and Kunwoo Lee,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018306227,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.11.003,0003-6870,2019,263--271,75,Applied Ergonomics,A novel approach to predict ingress/egress discomfort based on human motion and biomechanical analysis,article,KIM2019263
"The WOMBAT pilot selection test is widely used to select candidates for pilot training programs. Despite use in many countries, little information is available regarding the predictive validity of the test. This study was designed to test the ability of the WOMBAT test to predict performance outcomes in a sample of ab-initio pilots. Sixty students commenced the study in 3 cohorts, and completed the WOMBAT test before their performance in the training program was evaluated through flight time to solo, flight time to licence level achievement, and instructor ratings of performance. Higher WOMBAT total scores were significantly related to reduced time to solo, achieving flight licences, as well as some early ratings of performance by flight instructors. Further research now needs to examine the exact nature of the skills and abilities that the test indexes in order to further improve pilot selection and training procedures.","Selection test, Validation, Aviation, Pilots, Training, Human factors, Aviation psychology",Carlo Caponecchia and Wu Yi Zheng and Michael A.

"Particular design features intended to improve usability â?? including graphically displayed observations and integrated colour-based scoring-systems â?? have been shown to increase the speed and accuracy with which users of hospital observation charts detect abnormal patient observations. We used eye-tracking to evaluate two potential cognitive mechanisms underlying these effects. Novice chart-users completed a series of experimental trials in which they viewed patient data presented on one of three observation chart designs (varied within-subjects), and indicated which observation was abnormal (or that none were). A chart that incorporated both graphically displayed observations and an integrated colour-based scoring-system yielded faster, more accurate responses and fewer, shorter fixations than a graphical chart without a colour-based scoring-system. The latter, in turn, yielded the same advantages over a tabular chart (which incorporated neither design feature). These results suggest that both colour-based scoring-systems and graphically displayed observations improve search efficiency and reduce the cognitive resources required to process vital sign data.","Clinical deterioration, Patient safety, Human factors",Lillian Cornish and Andrew Hill and Mark S.

"The aim of this study is to investigate the neuromuscular response of shoulder muscles at different attachment heights of a carrying system during arm movement. It was hypothesized that (1) different height adjustments lead to changes in muscle activity and (2) the shoulder horizontal provides a benchmark for the optimal attachment height of the shoulder belts. The musculus deltoideus was significantly relieved after the elevation of the shoulder belt for subjects with an initial attachment height of 2â?¯cm below the shoulder. The musculus trapezius was relieved with the elevation above the shoulder. At a height of more than 2â?¯cm above the shoulder, no further muscle unloading was achieved. These findings prove that a height adjustment can provide a systematic unloading or deloading of the shoulder musculature. Despite the fact that the magnitude and direction of changes in muscle activity lead to rather individual responses, the intra-individual responses are consistent. Therefore, support systems should provide the range of individual requirements.","Electromyography, Height adjustment, Carriage system",S. Kratzenstein and M. Wanstrath and K.

"Night vision goggles (NVGs) enable aircrew to complete missions in the cover of night, but dramatically increase and alter the distribution of mass borne by the head. Our novel approach to visual target acquisition, based on Fittsâ?? Law, was used to assess differences across three different performance metrics between low (L) and high (H) head supported mass (HSM) conditions. Fifteen healthy male participants completed time-optimal and reciprocal visual target acquisitions between target pairs arranged in four different movement trajectories. A significant interaction effect was found and subsequent post hoc analysis revealed that participants required more time to acquire the 20â?¯mm target in the H-HSM condition. In the H-HSM condition participants had a higher error index during target acquisition and required more time to move off the target. Our approach demonstrates great promise in distinguishing performance decrements associated with the use of helmeted systems that include NVGs.","Fitts' Law, Head supported mass, Visual target acquisition performance",Aaron J.

"Many individuals work in jobs that require them to spend much of their day walking. There is evidence to suggest that shoe insoles may reduce the lower extremity discomfort for these workers. This study compared the effects of static and dynamic shoe insoles on lower extremity forces when walking at different speeds. Tibial acceleration (a.k.a. tibial shock) was assessed bilaterally in 30 participants who walked in both athletic shoes and work boots without any additional insole, with additional static insoles, and with additional dynamic insoles. The participants walked a prescribed course at a â??slowâ?, â??normalâ?, and â??fastâ? pace. With both shoe types, there were significant reductions in tibial shock values when insoles were used. With the work boots, the dynamic insole further reduced tibial shock relative to the static insole. The significant interactions show that the differences between insole conditions become greater with faster walking speeds.","Insoles, Tibial shock, Tibial acceleration, Distribution centers",Steven A.

"Human visual inspection skills remain superior for ensuring product quality and conformance to standards in the manufacturing industry. However, at present these skills cannot be formally shared with other workers or used to develop and implement new solutions or assistive technologies because they involve a high level of tacit knowledge which only exists in skilled operators' internal cognitions. Industry needs reliable methods for the capture and analysis of this tacit knowledge so that it can be shared and not lost but also so that it can be best utilised in the transfer of manual work to automated systems and introduction of new technologies and processes. This paper describes two UK manufacturing case studies that applied systematic task analysis methods to capture and scrutinise the tacit knowledge and skills being applied in the visual inspection of aerospace components. Results reveal that the method was effective in eliciting tacit knowledge, and showed that tacit skills are particularly needed when visual inspection standards lack specification or the task requires greater subjective interpretation. The implications of these findings for future research and for developments in the manufacturing industry are discussed.","Tacit knowledge, Visual inspection, Task analysis",T.L. Johnson and S.R.

"Mental workload is an important factor during driving, as both high and low levels may result in driver error. This research examined the mental workload of drivers caused by changes in road environment and how such changes impact upon behaviour, physiological responses, eye movements and brain activity. The experiment used functional near infrared spectroscopy to record prefrontal cortex activation associated with changes in mental workload during simulated driving. Increases in subjective ratings of mental workload caused by changes in road type were accompanied by increases in skin conductance, acceleration signatures and horizontal spread of search. Such changes were also associated with increases in the concentration of oxygenated haemoglobin in the prefrontal cortex. Mental workload fluctuates during driving. Such changes can be identified using a range of measures which could be used to inform the development of in-vehicle devices and partially autonomous systems.","Mental workload, Prefrontal cortex, fNIRS",Hannah J.

"Seat effective amplitude transmissibilities (SEAT values) quantify the influence of seats on discomfort caused by vibration. This study investigated SEAT values with vertical mechanical shocks at low, medium, and high magnitudes (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0â?¯msâ??1.75) at frequencies between 1.0 and 16â?¯Hz. With 18 subjects sitting on a rigid seat and two foam cushions, SEAT values were measured objectively (from the transmitted vibration), measured subjectively (by the responses of subjects), and predicted (using a model of the seat-passenger system). Except with high magnitude low frequency shocks, predicted SEAT values were similar to measured SEAT values. With shocks causing subjects to rise off a cushion and subsequently impact the cushion (low frequencies around 1â?¯g), subjective SEAT values were better estimated using predicted SEAT values than objectively measured SEAT values, because accelerometers on cushions exaggerated the impact of the falling subject. However, accelerometers on rigid seats will underestimate such impacts.","Seat vibration, Mechanical shocks, Biodynamic modelling",Giulia Patelli and Michael J.

"Through the detailed account of a design case-study, the paper aims to demonstrate how the activity-oriented approach promotes a systems perspective in ergonomics interventions. Specifically, by presenting an activity-oriented re-design of a tram drivers' workstation, it is shown: (i) how technical and contextual aspects were jointly considered, (ii) how their combination affects workers' activity in a non-trivial manner, and (iii) how this system level view helped generate feasible and sustainable design solutions. First, the activity-oriented theoretical lens is briefly presented, followed by the analysis of the tram driving activity, emphasizing on drivers' efforts to compensate for the original work-system design flaws. Next, key elements of the re-design process are presented, through a concept map, combining technical and contextual aspects, coupled with an account of stakeholder debates and resolution processes.

"Forty-three occupational health professionals (observers) and 90 workers were enrolled in this study to perform the cross-cultural adaptation of the Rapid Office Strain Assessment into Brazilian Portuguese (ROSA-Br) and evaluate its psychometric properties. After cross-cultural adaptation, the measurement properties were checked in three stages: study 1: pre-testing (27 observers rated 15 office worker videos), study 2: intra- and inter-observer reliability (26 observers rated 15 office worker videos), and study 3: validity and accuracy of ROSA-Br final scores (90 office workers). For the ROSA scores, acceptable intraclass correlation coefficients were found for 75% and 86% of the intra-observer reliability comparisons for non-trained and trained observers, respectively, and for 100% of the inter-observer reliability comparisons (0.43â??0.86). For construct validity, moderate correlations were observed for 70% of the comparisons between ROSA final scores and other ergonomic instruments. Moderate accuracy was observed for a ROSA-Br final score of 6 (AUC [area under the curve]â?¯=â?¯0.72, 0.89).

"Illuminated emergency exit signs inform building occupants about safe egress routes in emergencies. These exit signs are often found in the presence of other colored signs, which may distract occupants when searching for safe exits. Such distractions can lead to confusing and even harmful outcomes, especially if occupants misinterpret the sign colors, mistaking non-exit signs for exit signs. We studied which colored signs people were most likely to infer were exit signs in a simulated emergency evacuation using virtual reality (VR). Participants were immersed in a virtual room with two doors (left and right), and an illuminated sign with different colored vertical bars above each door. They saw all pairwise combinations of six sign colors across trials. On each trial, a fire alarm sounded, and participants walked to the door that they thought was the exit. We tested two hypotheses: a local exposure hypothesis that color inferences are determined by exit sign colors in the local environment (i.e., red) and a semantic association hypothesis that color inferences are determined by color-concept associations (i.e. green associated with â??goâ? and â??safetyâ?). The results challenged the local exposure hypothesis and supported the semantic association hypothesis. Participants predominantly walked toward green signs, even though the exit signs in the local environmentâ??including the building where the experiment took placeâ??were red. However, in a post-experiment survey, most participants reported that exit signs should be red. The results demonstrated a dissociation between the way observers thought they would behave in emergency situations (redâ?¯=â?¯exit) and the way they did behave in simulated emergencies (greenâ?¯=â?¯exit). These findings have implications for the design of evacuation systems. Observers, and perhaps designers, do not always anticipate how occupants will behave in emergency situations, which emphasizes the importance of behavioral evaluations for egress safety.","Emergency exit signs, Evacuation, Virtual reality, Color cognition, Visual reasoning",Max Kinateder and William H.

"Cognitive Work Analysis is an original method that seeks to describe work systems made up of nested sets of constraints, from ecological constraints imposed by the work domain to cognitive constraints. This top-down approach starts with a work domain model in order to analyze and specify contexts of activity. To complement this method, we propose a bottom-up version of Cognitive Work Analysis focusing on contexts of activity and depicting how operators adapt to the ecological constraints. Based on Rasmussen's Dynamic Safety Model, the ecological constraints involved are those bounding the workspace in which operators dynamically navigate with control loops, strategies, work organization, and competencies. This analysis relies on the simulation of specific contexts of activity. A first illustrative application of this framework to a simulated medical emergency situation with a team of nurses and nursing aids shows that this framework can help identify design issues.","Heuristic cognitive work analysis, Simulation, Medical emergency",Thierry Morineau and John M.

"Biomechanical overload in the wrist flexor and extensor muscles, together with awkward hand positions during work activities, can result in occupational wrist and hand disorders. Dairy workers, specifically those that work in the milking parlor, are exposed to highly repetitive and forceful exertions of the upper limb throughout their work shift. There are very few studies that have investigated the determinants that contribute to the risk of distal upper limb musculoskeletal disorders among dairy workers. The purpose of the present study was to identify the variables affecting the biomechanical overload of the distal upper limb among milking parlor workers, define risk profiles, and propose possible interventions to reduce the high physical loads to the distal upper limb during milking activities. Forty male workers from the three most common milking parlor systems in Lombardy Italy were recruited to participate in this study. Multiple correspondence analysis of personal characteristics and occupational risk factors, followed by cluster analysis, led to the identification of three distinct groups of workers. Low, medium and high risk profiles were assigned to each group based on the risk assessments performed using the Strain Index and electromyography of the distal upper limb. The main risk determinants were workstation characteristics, work organization and milking routine. A well-organized milking routine, milking cluster weight below 2.4â?¯kg or the use of supporting arms for the milking cluster may reduce the risk of biomechanical overload.","Dairy workers, Risk assessment, Strain index, Surface electromyography",F.

"Manual materials handling is often performed in hazardous environments where protective footwear must be worn; however, workers can wear different types of footwear depending on the hazards present. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate how three-dimensional lifting mechanics and trunk local dynamic stability are affected by different types of protective footwear (i.e. steel-toed shoes (unlaced boot), steel-toed boots (work boot), and steel-toed boots with a metatarsal guard (MET)). Twelve males and twelve females performed a repetitive lifting task at 10% of their maximum lifting effort, under three randomized footwear conditions. Footwear type influenced ankle range of motion (ROM). The work boot condition reduced ankle sagittal ROM (pâ?¯=â?¯0.007) and the MET condition reduced ankle ROM in the sagittal (pâ?¯=â?¯0.004), frontal (pâ?¯=â?¯0.001) and transverse (pâ?¯=â?¯0.003) planes.

"This study examined the associations between bio-mathematical fatigue-risk scores and sickness absence (SA) in hospital nurses over 18 months. Work schedules and SA data were extracted from the hospital's attendance system. Fatigue-risk scores were generated for work days using the Fatigue Audit InterDyne (FAID) and Fatigue Risk Index (FRI). Over the study period, 5.4% of the shifts were absence shifts. FAID-fatigue ranged from 7 to 154; scores for a standard 9â??5 work schedule can range from 7 to 40.

The subjects' postures were acquired non-invasively using cameras; software and instruments for virtual prototyping were used for posture analysis and interaction modelling, both questionnaires (subjective) and comfort-analysis software (objective) were used to rate the perceived (dis)comfort. The results obtained from simulations and questionnaires were compared, and a method to weigh the effect of the perceived spinal discomfort on overall postural (dis)comfort was proposed. These results reveal a good correlation between subjective perception and objective evaluation obtained through simulations, confirming the validity of the proposed method.","Comfort evaluation, Non-invasive postural analysis, Vending machines, Spine discomfort, Information fusion",Alessandro Naddeo and Rosaria Califano and Mariarosaria Vallone and Arianna Cicalese and Chiara Coccaro and Federica Marcone and Ervis Shullazi,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018303375,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.08.025,0003-6870,2019,194--205,74,Applied Ergonomics,The effect of spine discomfort on the overall postural (dis)comfort,article,NADDEO2019194
"The aim of this study is to understand interindividual differences in defensive behaviour in elite volleyball players facing similar game situations. This recurrent observation leads us to adopt an activity-centred ergonomic approach. Two case studies are conducted in naturalistic contexts. In the first, thirty-one professional players are observed in order to account for typical forms of behaviour in relation to certain specific sets of game situations. Two characteristic populations are distinguished. The second study uses observations and self-confrontation interviews with twelve players representative of each population in order to characterise their situation assessment. Results highlight important contrasts between the two populations, both in behaviour and in situation assessment. They suggest that one norm of activity centred on the rally-ending issue and another on the roles to be assumed, guide the specific coherency of these populations under time pressure. The identification of these norms provides a hypothesis concerning the foundations of sensemaking. Implications for training development are discussed.","Activity, Time pressure, Situation assessment, Sensemaking, Norm, Defensive behaviour, Sport",Michel RÃ©copÃ© and HÃ©lÃ¨ne Fache and Joffrey Beaujouan and Fabien Coutarel and GÃ©raldine Rix-LiÃ¨vre,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018301911,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.07.003,0003-6870,2019,226--237,80,Applied Ergonomics,A study of the individual activity of professional volleyball players: Situation assessment and sensemaking under time pressure,article,RECOPE2019226
"In the near future, more vehicles will have automated functions. The traffic system will be a shared space of automated and manually driven vehicles. In our study we focused on the perspective of vulnerable road users, namely pedestrians, in cooperative situations with automated vehicles. Established communication methods, such as eye-contact between pedestrians and drivers, may no longer work when automated vehicles represent the interaction partner. Therefore, we evaluated several human-machine-interfaces (HMI) in order to implement smooth and comfortable communication. We conducted a two-stage study consisting of an explorative focus group discussion with naÃ¯ve pedestrians (nâ?¯=â?¯6), followed by an experimental video simulation study (nâ?¯=â?¯25) based on the results of the focus group discussion. From the focus group we sought member opinion about various HMI, upon presentation of acoustic and visual communication systems such as projections, displays and LED light strips, in addition to portable communication systems, specifically smart watches. On the basis of the focus group discussion, an evaluation criteria was derived. For the video simulation study, HMI designs were created with variations in position, type and coding of the message, and technology. These were assessed by 25 subjects according to the focus discussion derived evaluation criteria: recognizability, unambiguousness, interaction comfort and intuitive comprehensibility. The results show that direct instructions to cross the street are preferred over status information of the vehicle and that large-scale text-based messages from the vehicle to the pedestrian, deliver better results. Design recommendations for HMIs for communication between automated vehicles are derived, and the extent external HMIs may supplement informal communication strategies such as vehicle movement or braking maneuvers, is discussed.","Automated vehicles, Pedestrian-automation-interaction, HMI evaluation, HMI design recommendations",Claudia Ackermann and Matthias Beggiato and Sarah Schubert and Josef F.

"Landmarks, objects in the environment used for orientation, navigation and the formation of cognitive maps are often represented in maps as pictograms. In order to support these tasks effectively and efficiently, landmark pictograms also need to be salient, as the map user needs to identify and process them quickly and easily. Two additional relevant characteristics for the usability of landmark pictograms are their meaningfulness and recognition performance. Meaningfulness is required to understand which categories of objects are represented by the pictograms. Ease of recognition prevents the necessity to consult a map repetitively and may support the formation of a cognitive map of the environment. In the present study, we investigated the relation between salience, meaningfulness and recognition performance of OpenStreetMap (OSM) pictograms and the potential effects of the visual complexity of pictograms on these usability characteristics. Salience was measured via eye fixations on specific pictograms, meaningfulness with an explicit continuous scale and recognition performance with a yes/no recognition memory paradigm. Statistical analyses showed that pictograms drew more visual attention if they were visually complex or if their meaning was inapprehensible or ambiguous. Less apprehensible pictograms were also recognized more often. Interestingly, the data indicated that longer fixations could lead to worse recognition performance. Long fixations on a pictogram may increase the likelihood of false recognition in subsequent situations where the pictogram is no longer valid or relevant. Based on the findings, we suggest balancing the meaningfulness and visual complexity of contiguous pictograms to enhance their recognition and to provide an optimal level of salience of single objects.","Cognitive cartography, Empirical cartography, Spatial cognition, Volunteered geographic information, Landmarks, Pictograms, Salience, Memory, Recognition, Meaningfulness, Cartosemiotics",Julian Keil and Dennis Edler and Frank Dickmann and Lars Kuchinke,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018305714,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.10.008,0003-6870,2019,214--220,75,Applied Ergonomics,Meaningfulness of landmark pictograms reduces visual salience and recognition performance,article,KEIL2019214
"Repetitive work is common in the modern workplace and the effects are often studied using fatigue protocols; however, there is evidence that the manner in which fatigue develops impacts the kinematic and muscular response to reduced physical capacity. The purpose of this study was to simultaneously evaluate muscular and kinematic adaptations during fatiguing, repetitive work until exhaustion. We measured muscle activity in 13 muscles in the shoulder and trunk, and captured full body kinematics while participants completed simulated, repetitive work tasks. Every 12â?¯min, reference data were collected to quantify fatigue. This sequence continued until they reached the termination criteria. Participants displayed significant signs of muscle fatigue, loss of strength and increased perceived fatigue (pâ?¯<â?¯0.05). Analysis revealed a significant effect of time on posture and muscle activity that was both task and time dependent, and variable both between and within individuals. Participants were able to compensate for reduced physical capacity and maintain task performance through coordinated compensation strategies.","Dynamic work, Shoulder, Fatigue, Variability",Alison C.

"The closing of loops exerts magical effects. This powerful act sculpts both the structural form and the functional expression of the systems which accrue from this ultimate connection. Systems and societies are each erected upon, and composed of, such intricate webs of self-correcting and self-shaping influences. However, without appropriate feedback regulation, these loops can become, in a utilitarian sense, dysfunctional. This is as true for social architectures as it is for any intentionally designed technological system. Here, a sequence of examples are used to expose an evident divergence between what is espoused for our social systems and what is actually enacted therein. Failure of regulation and associated diminution or even disconnection of such regulatory loops leads to an evident and growing dissonance between aspiration and reality. The first two of these examples used here are rather facile and even trivial while the third example is much more serious. All examples provide insight concerning, and expose the ways in which, a fuller understanding of cybernetic principles may rectify such discordant circumstances, at least in principle if not in practice.",,P.A.

"Increasing concerns about musculoskeletal disorders in the upper back arising from excessive daily use of the smartwatch have been widely validated by the rising prevalence of discomfort. This study explored the smartwatch as a potential ergonomic intervention over the smartphone. Fourteen healthy participants completed five tasks (application setting, calling, message typing, message checking and vocal message entry) with smartphone and smartwatch in both sitting and standing postures. The neck-shoulder kinematics and muscle activation levels were monitored to assess the effects of the tasks, devices, and postures. The results indicated greater head flexion, head rotation and shoulder abduction and greater muscle activities for smartwatch use compared to smartphone use, but the performance measure (i.e., elapsed time) was superior for smartwatch use in all tasks except message typing. Collectively, only short and simple tasks such as message checking and application setting should be conducted with the smartwatch.","Smartwatch, Smartphone, Head flexion",Sangeun Jin and Minsung Kim and Jihyeon Park and Minsung Jang and Kyuseok Chang and Daemin Kim,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018307051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.11.009,0003-6870,2019,105--112,76,Applied Ergonomics,A comparison of biomechanical workload between smartphone and smartwatch while sitting and standing,article,JIN2019105
"The aim of this study was to assess postures and movements of the trunk and upper arm during paper mill work, and to determine the extent to which they differ depending on method of assessment. For each of 28 paper mill workers, postures and movements were assessed during three full shifts using inclinometer registration and observation from video. Summary metrics for each shift, e.g., 10th, 50th, and 90th posture percentile, were averaged across shifts and across workers. In addition, the standard deviation between workers, and the standard deviation between shifts within worker were computed. The results showed that trunk and arm postures during paper mill work were similar to other occupations involving manual materials handling, but the velocities of arm movements were lower. While postures determined by inclinometry and observation were similar on a group level, substantial differences were found between results obtained by the two methods for individual workers, particularly for extreme postures. Thus, measurements by either method on individuals or small groups should be interpreted with caution.","Exposure, Inclinometry, Observation",Marina Heiden and Camilla Zetterberg and Svend Erik Mathiassen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018307294,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.12.004,0003-6870,2019,90--96,76,Applied Ergonomics,Trunk and upper arm postures in paper mill work,article,HEIDEN201990
"The construction industry takes an orthodox approach to safety: Finding root causes, quantifying risk, and often blaming frontline workers. However, safety has reached a plateau and the limitations of this approach are starting to be acknowledged. A sociotechnical systems approach (as applied in the ConCA model) presents new opportunities to understand accident causation by linking immediate accident circumstances with the distal shaping and originating influences. 32 construction safety managers, consultants, and experts contributed their views regarding the hazards of construction (both human and physical) and the difficulties managing these. The findings provide an insight into the work of construction safety managers and their decision making which is influenced by industry-wide pressures and worker attributes over physical hazards. Construction suffers from a wide range of pressures; a combination of both top-down, from the client, and bottom-up challenges from the workforce it attracts. The original ConCA model has been revised to reflect the findings. By applying systems thinking, the relationships between negative perceptions of workers' risk-taking and these challenges can be crystallised. The results support integrating safety into primary activities to increase engagement, learning legacies to transfer knowledge between projects, multi-disciplinary teams to raise risk awareness, empowerment to combat their feelings of dissatisfaction and disloyalty, and collaboration in risk management to incorporate workers' expertise and ensure they feel valued.","Construction, Safety, Sociotechnical systems",Eleanor J.

"The development of musculoskeletal disorders has been linked to various risk factors in the work environment including lifting heavy loads, machine and materials handling, work postures, repetitive work, work with handheld vibrating tools, and work stress. The Quick Exposure Check (QEC) was designed to assess exposure to work-related musculoskeletal risk factors affecting the back, shoulder/arm, wrist/hand, and neck. We investigated the inter-rater reliability of the summary scores and individual items of the QEC by comparing two simultaneous assessments of 51 work tasks, performed by 14 different workers. The work tasks were mainly â??lightâ? to â??moderately heavyâ?. For total scores, the level of disagreement for shoulder/arm had a Relative Position of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.02; 0.23) and no statistically significant random disagreement. Percentage agreement was 63â??100% for individual items and 71â??88% for total score. Weighted Kappa of agreement for the individual items rated by the assessors were â??0.94â??0.77; highest for back motion, and lowest for wrist/hand position.

"As a new type of Virtual Reality (VR) headset, VR glasses rise rapidly in a number of areas. It's essential to understand the importance of user experience (UX) on VR glasses design. This study aimed to develop questionnaires for evaluating VR glasses' UX, as well as to investigate the relationship between various UX variables. With using lab-based usability tests, this study analyzed participants' self-reports and performance based on testing eight VR glasses and seven mobile applications. A nine-item questionnaire and a ten-item questionnaire were successfully developed to measure VR glasses systems' UX quality in terms of hardware and application, respectively. Within a proposed UX evaluation framework, the perceived UX quality relative to VR glasses hardware emerged as a core predictor in predicting interactive operation performance, whereas the application UX perception was a significant predictor of motion sickness.","VR glasses system, User experience evaluation, Interactive operation, Motion sickness",Mengli Yu and Ronggang Zhou and Huiwen Wang and Weihua Zhao,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018302850,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.08.012,0003-6870,2019,206--213,74,Applied Ergonomics,An evaluation for VR glasses system user experience: The influence factors of interactive operation and motion sickness,article,YU2019206
"Communication breakdowns in the referral process negatively impact clinical workflow and patient safety. There is a lack of evidence demonstrating the impact of published design recommendations addressing contributing issues with consultation order templates. This study translated the recommendations into a computer-based prototype and conducted a comparative usability evaluation. With a scenario-based simulation, 30 clinicians (referrers) participated in a within-group, counterbalanced experiment comparing the prototype with their present electronic order entry system. The prototype significantly increased satisfaction (Cohen's dâ?¯=â?¯1.80, 95% CI [1.19, 2.41], pâ?¯<â?¯.001), and required significantly less mental effort (dâ?¯=â?¯0.67 [0.14, 1.20], pâ?¯<â?¯.001). Regarding efficiency, the prototype required significantly fewer mouse clicks (mean differenceâ?¯=â?¯29 clicks, pâ?¯<â?¯.001). Although overall task time did not differ significantly (dâ?¯=â?¯â??0.05 [â??0.56, 0.47]), the prototype significantly quickened identification of the appropriate specialty clinic (mean differenceâ?¯=â?¯12â?¯s, dâ?¯=â?¯0.98 [0.43, 1.52], pâ?¯<â?¯.001).

"Limited information is available regarding the effective use of workplace head-worn displays (HWD), especially the choices of HWD types and user interface (UI) designs. We explored how different HWD types and UI designs affect perceived workload, usability, visual discomfort, and job performance during a simulated warehouse job involving order picking and part assembly. Sixteen gender-balanced participants completed the simulated job in all combinations of two HWD types (binocular vs. monocular) and four UIs, the latter of which manipulated information mode (text-vs. graphic-based) and information availability (always-on vs. on-demand); a baseline condition was also completed (paper pick list). Job performance, workload, and usability were more affected by UI designs than HWD type. For example, the graphic-based UI reduced job completion time and number of errors by â?¼13% and â?¼59%, respectively. Participants had no strong preference for either of the HWD types, suggesting that the physical HWD designs tested are suboptimal.","Head-worn display, Augmented reality, User interface, Performance",Sunwook Kim and Maury A.

"Technical advances in inertial measurement units (IMUs) with data logging functionality have enabled multi-day collection of fullshift upper arm postures and movements. Such data are useful for characterizing job-level exposures and, when coupled with task-level information, can inform interventions to mitigate high-exposure tasks. Previously reported methods for capturing task-level information, however, were limited primarily to self-report diaries or direct observation. In this study of machine-paced manufacturing workers (n=6), a low-cost radio frequency identification (RFID) system was used to collect information about when, and for how long, specific assembly tasks were performed during up to 14 consecutive work shifts (76 total work shifts across the six participants). The RFID data were compared to information collected with a self-report diary using Bland-Altman analyses. In addition, the RFID data were paired with IMU data to identify task-level exposures from within full-shift recordings of upper arm postures and movements. These data were then used to estimate the relative contributions of between- and within-worker sources of variance to overall variance in posture and movement summary measures using hierarchical random-effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques. Average estimates of daily task duration based on RFID data were comparable to estimates obtained by self-report (mean bias < Â±1 minute) but with substantial variability (limits of agreement > Â±100 minutes). In addition, the ANOVA models containing task-level information suggested a substantial amount of the overall exposure variance was attributed to repeated observations of the same task within a work day. These findings (i) suggest that while the RFID system used in this study performed adequately, further refinement, validation, and/or alternative strategies may be needed and (ii) underscore the importance of repeated full-shift and task-based measurement approaches in characterizing physical exposures, even in machine-paced environments.","Exposure variability, Upper arm posture, RFID, Task-based measurement",Joshua T.

The results showed that process factors such as objectives, financial and time resources, employee participation and empowerment, and methodological approach contributed to the outcomes. Perceived performance and employee satisfaction with the physical environment increased significantly after the relocation. Employee empowerment, highlighted by the employees, correlated with the performance and satisfaction parameters.

"Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) can contribute to sustainable transport. Yet, their real-world energy efficiency depends on HEV drivers' eco-driving behaviour. Eco-driving knowledge is key for successful eco-driving. The present research focused on the role of perceived strategy knowledge (know-how) versus technical system knowledge (know-why) in a study with 121 HEV drivers. The relationship between knowledge components and knowledge acquisition processes, as well as fuel efficiency, were examined. Structural equation modelling results indicated that perceived strategy knowledge was related to acquisition by testing (i.e., interacting with the vehicle and its interfaces) and reading (i.e., manuals, books and websites) while technical system knowledge was only related to acquisition by reading. In contrast to technical system knowledge, perceived strategy knowledge was no significant predictor of fuel efficiency. The results indicated that emphasis should be put into promoting technical system knowledge (e.g., by tutoring systems) to support motivated drivers' in achieving higher fuel efficiency.","Eco-driving, Knowledge acquisition, User-energy interaction",Matthias G.

"The present article examined the effects of using different extra-laboratorial testing procedures in usability testing. Three experiments were conducted using different artefacts (website, computer-simulated mobile phone, fully operational smartphone) to compare different methodological approaches in field testing (synchronous and asynchronous remote testing, classical field testing) to lab-based testing under different operational conditions (dual task demands, poor product usability). Typical outcome variables of usability testing were measured, including task completion time, click rate, perceived usability and workload. Overall, the results showed no differences between field and lab-based testing under favourable operational conditions. However, under difficult operational conditions (i.e. dual task demands, poor product usability) differences between field and lab-based testing emerged (corresponding to small and medium effect sizes). The findings showed a complex pattern of effects, suggesting that there was no general advantage of one testing procedure over another.","Usability test, Remote testing, Field testing, Synchronous testing, Asynchronous testing",Juergen Sauer and Andreas Sonderegger and Klaus Heyden and Jasmin Biller and Julia Klotz and Andreas Uebelbacher,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018302849,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.08.011,0003-6870,2019,85--96,74,Applied Ergonomics,Extra-laboratorial usability tests: An empirical comparison of remote and classical field testing with lab testing,article,SAUER201985
"Tables of maximal acceptable weight limits (MAWL) are used to select safe lifting loads and help reduce workplace injuries. However, their subjective basis provides little information on the underlying load selection rationale, and few studies have examined MAWLs in relation to full-body joint demands. Therefore, link-segment biomechanical modeling was applied for 18 participants during three sagittal 4.3 lifts/minute tasks at chosen MAWL levels. Each lift produced unique kinematics, kinetics, MAWL loads and most highly stressed joints. Lifting from the lowest starting position most heavily challenged the L5/S1 joint, whereas more upright starting postures stressed the shoulder. Lifting loads above and below MAWL level demonstrated consistent joint loading patterns. The normalized peak moments of the highest stressed joint were similar across the lifts at â?¼70â??75% of the joint maximum.

"An experimental protocol with five tasks is proposed for a low-cost empirical assessment of the reachable 3-D workspace (RWS), including both close-to-torso and far-from-torso regions. Ten participants repeated the protocol for four distinct hand payloads. The RWS expressed as a point cloud and its non-convex alpha-shape were obtained for each case. Moreover, individual strength surrogates for glenohumeral flexion and abduction, and elbow flexion were collected using a dynamometer. The RWS volume was statistically modelled using payload, body-mass-index and the strength surrogates as predictors. For increasing payload, a significant (râ?¯=â?¯â??0.736,pâ?¯<â?¯0.001) decrease in RWS volume was found for distinct payload cases across all subjects. The only significant predictors found for the RWS volume were normalized payload (Fâ?¯=â?¯73.740,pâ?¯<â?¯0.001) and body-mass-index (Fâ?¯=â?¯11.008,pâ?¯=â?¯0.003). No significant interactions were found. The consequent regression model (F(2,27)â?¯=â?¯41.11, pâ?¯<â?¯0.001, Radj2â?¯=â?¯0.7345) explained around 73% of the variation in the data.

"This study was conducted to examine the effect of a posture correctionâ??based intervention (with a biofeedback device) on the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS) and fatigue among control room operators in a petrochemical plant in Iran. A total of 188 office workers (91 in the case group and 97 in the control group) participated at baseline as well as at 6- and 12-month follow-up. A questionnaire survey (including the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory) and direct observations of working postures by using the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) method were used. The occurrence of MSS in the shoulders, upper back, neck, and low back areas, as well as the mental and physical dimensions of fatigue were found to be the most common problems. The results showed considerable improvements in working postures (in the neck, trunk, and RULA grand scores) and the occurrence of MSS (particularly in the neck, shoulders, and upper back and low back areas) and fatigue (in particular the mental and physical aspects) after the intervention. The overall mean RULA grand score for the case group was significantly decreased after the intervention (mean scores of 5.1, 4.4, and 4.6â?¯at pre-intervention, post-intervention 1, and post-intervention 2, respectively). A total of 81 operators (89.0%) reported some kind of MSS at baseline, which were reduced to 75 operators (82.4%) and 77 operators (84.6%) at post-interventions 1 and 2, respectively. Significant differences were also found between the pre- and post-intervention scores for the physical fatigue (mean of 12.19, 10.16, and 9.99â?¯at pre-intervention, post-intervention 1, and post-intervention 2, respectively) and mental fatigue (mean of 14.03, 12.05, and 12.16â?¯at pre-intervention, post-intervention 1, and post-intervention 2, respectively) dimensions.

"This study quantified the biomechanical (movements and forces) and physiological (energy expenditure) demands of postal delivery performed with electrically assisted bicycles (EABs). Ten postal workers and 10 recreational athletes performed three simulated postal tasks (simulated mail delivery circuit, delivery distance [close vs. far], and 3-min stationary cycling) while carrying 0, 16 and 32â?¯kg.

Energy expenditure (10â??20%; pâ?¯<â?¯0.05) and power output (30â??44%; pâ?¯<â?¯0.05) increased with increasing mail loads. Ground reaction force increased (â?¼10%) for the far delivery distance, but joint reaction forces were unchanged. Lower hip flexion (pâ?¯<â?¯0.01), less hip abduction (pâ?¯<â?¯0.01) and larger spine anterior flexion (pâ?¯<â?¯0.01) were observed for the far delivery distance.

"This article examines the influence of using easy-to-read language (as an important web accessibility criterion to support users with disabilities) on nondisabled users. A web site usability test was conducted with 128 nondisabled participants. Each participant evaluated one of two web site versions: conventional language vs. easy-to-read language. Measures of performance (e.g., recognition of content and reading time) and subjective user reactions (e.g., perceived usability and text liking) were taken. The results showed that easy-to-read language (compared to conventional language) led to improvements for some performance measures (e.g., recognition of content) but also to increased reading time, decreased text liking and reduced intention to revisit the web site. This article concludes that when implementing easy-to-read language in web sites, adverse as well as beneficial effects on nondisabled users need to be considered.","Web accessibility, Easy-to-read language, Nondisabled users",Sven Schmutz and Andreas Sonderegger and Juergen Sauer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018302862,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.08.013,0003-6870,2019,97--106,74,Applied Ergonomics,Easy-to-read language in disability-friendly web sites: Effects on nondisabled users,article,SCHMUTZ201997
"This study evaluated loading on the low back while wearing two commercially available postural assist exoskeletons. Ten male subjects lifted a box from multiple lift origins (combinations of vertical height and asymmetry) to a common destination using a squatting lifting technique with and without the use of either exoskeleton. Dependent measures included subject kinematics, moment arms between the torso or weight being lifted and the lumbar spine, and spinal loads as predicted by an electromyography-driven spine model. One of the exoskeletons tested (StrongArm Technologiesâ?¢ FLx) reduced peak torso flexion at the shin lift origin, but differences in moment arms or spinal loads attributable to either of the interventions were not observed. Thus, industrial exoskeletons designed to control posture may not be beneficial in reducing biomechanical loads on the lumbar spine. Interventions altering the external manual materials handling environment (lift origin, load weight) may be more appropriate when implementation is fesible.","Assistive device, Low back pain, Passive exoskeleton, Ergoskeleton",Michael T.

"Eye-tracking methodology was used to investigate lapses in the appropriate treatment of ward patients due to not noticing critical cues of deterioration. Forty nursing participants with different levels of experience participated in an interactive screen-based simulation of hypovolemic shock. The results show that 65% of the participants exhibited at least one episode of non-fixation on clinically relevant, fully visible cues that were in plain sight. Thirty-five percent of participants dwelt for sufficient time (>200â?¯ms) on important cues for perception to take place, but no action followed, indicating they had pattern-matching failure. When participants fail to notice what, they should notice in patient status until it is too late, this can have serious consequences.

"Clothing comfort is determined by multiple material and design factors. Wetness at the skin-clothing interface mainly impacts wear comfort. The current study investigated the combined effect of fabric contact area, fabric absolute sweat content and fabric moisture saturation percentage on wetness and stickiness sensations, during exercise. Moreover, factors causing wear (dis)comfort during exercise were identified. Higher fabric saturation percentage induced greater stickiness sensation, despite lower fabric contact area and absolute sweat content (typically associated with lower stickiness). Wetness perception did not change between fabrics with different saturation percentages, contact areas and sweat contents. Therefore, fabric saturation percentage mainly affects stickiness sensation of wet fabrics, overruling the impact of fabric contact area and absolute sweat content. No overall model of wear discomfort across all data could be developed, however, models for different time points were produced, with texture and stickiness sensations being the best predictors of wear discomfort at baseline and during exercise, respectively. This suggests that the factors determining clothing (dis)comfort are dynamics and alter importance during exercise activity.","Clothing comfort, Wetness perception, Stickiness sensation, Fabric contact area, Texture sensation",Margherita Raccuglia and Benjamin Sales and Christian Heyde and George Havenith and Simon Hodder,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018301376,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.05.014,0003-6870,2018,33--41,73,Applied Ergonomics,Clothing comfort during physical exercise â??

"The present study aimed at investigating how pre-activating prior topic knowledge before browsing the web can support information search performance and strategies of young and older users. The experiment focus on analyzing to what extent prior knowledge pre-activation might cope with older users' difficulties when interacting with a search engine. 26 older (age 60 to 77) and 22 young (age 18 to 32) adults performed 6 information search problems related to health and fantastic movies. Overall, results showed that pre-activating prior topic knowledge increased the time spent evaluating the search engine results pages, fostered deeper processing of the navigational paths elaborated (and thus reduced the exploration of different navigational paths) and improved the semantic specificity of queries. Pre-activating prior knowledge helped older adults produced semantically more specific queries when they had lower prior-knowledge than young adults. Moderation analyses indicated that the pre-activation supported older adults' search performance under the condition that participants generated semantically relevant keywords during this pre-activation task. Implications of these results show that prior topic knowledge pre-activation may be a good lead to support the beneficial role of prior knowledge in older usersâ?? search behavior and performance.

"The use of two cusp catastrophe models has been effective for untangling the effects of cognitive workload, fatigue, and other complications on the performance of individuals. This study is the first to use the two models to separate workload and fatigue effects on team performance. In an experiment involving an emergency response simulation, 360 undergraduates were organized into 44 teams. Workload was varied by team size, number of opponents, and time pressure. The cusp models for workload and fatigue were more accurate for describing trends in team performance criteria compared to linear alternatives. Individual differences in elasticity-rigidity were less important than subjective workload and experimental conditions as control variables. Fluid intelligence within the team was an important compensatory ability in the fatigue model. Results further supported the nonlinear paradigm for the assessment of cognitive workload and fatigue and demonstrated its effectiveness for understanding team phenomena.","Cognitive workload, Fatigue, Teams, Resilience, Cusp catastrophe, Emergency response",Stephen J.

Heart rate and skin conductance were higher during phone calling tasks than â??just drivingâ?, but did not consistently differentiate calling method. Participants exhibited more erratic driving behavior (lane position and major steering wheel reversals) for smartphone VM calling compared to both AV methods.

"Cranking the landing gear is a common task performed by truck drivers to raise or lower trailers. This task poses a risk to the shoulder joint due to the required forceful exertion and the posture constrained to the hand-handle interface. As a potential occupational risk, there has been no definitive guideline for best practices among truck drivers. An operator can crank perpendicular (frontal) or parallel (sagittal) to the crank rotation. In this laboratory study, the effects of cranking method and resistance on scapular range of motion and shoulder muscle activity were observed in 12 participants. Scapular posture was measured using an optical motion tracking system. EMG was monitored on 16 muscles contributing to shoulder movement. The results show that during frontal cranking, the scapular range of protraction was 28â?¯Â±â?¯11.6Â°, which was more than the sagittal cranking (23â?¯Â±â?¯10.4Â°), indicating a decreased subacromial space and elevated shoulder impingement risk. Seven muscles (all three deltoid muscles, middle trapezius, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor) demonstrated that when the crank resistance was low, the front cranking method resulted in lower activity than the side cranking. When the crank resistance was 20 Nm, the muscle activity on these seven muscles was greater when cranking from the front than from the side. Based on these observations, we suggest that when the resistance is low (lowering the trailer) the driver should stand facing the trailer. On the contrary, it is advantageous to stand parallel to the trailer and crank while raising the trailer to apply the full body strength to reduce the shoulder load.","Shoulders, Trucking, Musculoskeletal disorders, Best practice",Jia-Hua Lin and Xu Xu,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018304137,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.09.011,0003-6870,2019,129--133,75,Applied Ergonomics,Occupational cranking operations: The scapula perspective,article,LIN2019129
"This study investigated the relative impact of ultra-low travel keyboards on typing force, muscle activity, wrist posture, typing performance, and self-reported comfort/preference as compared to a conventional keyboard. In a repeated-measures laboratory-based study, 20 subjects were invited to type for 10â?¯min on each of five keyboards with different travel distances of 0.5, 0.7, 1.2, 1.6 (ultra-low travel keyboards), and 2.0â?¯mm (a conventional keyboard). During the typing sessions, we measured typing force; muscle activity in extrinsic finger muscles (flexor digitorum superficialis and extensor digitorum communis), shoulder (trapezius) and neck (splenius capitis); wrist posture; typing performance; and self-reported comfort/preference. While using the ultra-low travel keyboards, subjects typed with less force and wrist extension, and had more ulnar deviation (p'sâ?¯<â?¯0.0001) compared with conventional keyboard. However, these differences in typing forces were less than 0.5â?¯N and less than 4Â° for both wrist extension and ulnar deviation. The general trend of data did not show any consistent or substantial differences in muscle activity (less than 2 %MVC) and typing performance (<5 WPM in speed; < 3% in accuracy), despite the observed statistical difference in the finger flexors and extensors muscle activity (p'sâ?¯<â?¯0.19) and typing performance (pâ?¯<â?¯0.0001). However, the subjects preferred using conventional keyboards in most of the investigated self-reported comfort and preference criteria (p'sâ?¯<â?¯0.4). In conclusion, these small differences indicate that using ultra-low travel keyboards may not have substantial differences in biomechanical exposures and typing performance compared to conventional keyboard; however, the subjective responses indicated that the ultra-low keyboards with the shortest key travel tended to be the least preferred.","Electromyography, Force-displacement characteristics, Key travel distance, Computer-related musculoskeletal disorders, Usability",Kiana Kia and Jonathan Sisley and Peter W.

"Designing one seat for multi-sitters and multi-activities is challenging especially in a very restrained aircraft economy class cabin. In this paper, the effects of seat parameters and sitters' anthropometric dimensions on seat profile and optimal compressed seat pan surface were studied using a newly built multi-adjustable experimental seat. The â??optimalâ?? seat pan contact surface was obtained by controlling the height of 52 cylinders so that the normal contact force was distributed to all cylinders as evenly as possible. With 13 other motorized adjustments controllable by a computer, individual seat profile in the symmetry plane such as seat height, seat pan length, seat pan angle, lumbar protrusion and headrest position were also studied. Data were collected from 36 men and women of varying body size testing 40 seat configurations. Parametric models were obtained for predicting seat profile and optimal compressed seat pan seat surface in function of seat pan and back rest angles for two sitting postures. It is expected that the proposed parametric models provide necessary reference values in seat development for a better fit of a target population of sitters with large varying body size.","Seat comfort, Posture, Aircraft, Seat profile, Parametric modelling",Xuguang Wang and Michelle Cardoso and Georges Beurier,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018301388,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.05.015,0003-6870,2018,13--21,73,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of seat parameters and sittersâ?? anthropometric dimensions on seat profile and optimal compressed seat pan surface,article,WANG201813
"Objectives Both pneumatic rock drills and electric rotary hammer drills are used for drilling large holes (e.g., 10â??20â?¯mm diameter) into concrete for structural upgrades to buildings, highways, bridges, and airport tarmacs. However, little is known about the differences in productivity, and exposures to noise, handle vibration, and dust between the two types of drills. The aim of this study was to compare these outcomes with similar mass electric rotary and pneumatic rock drills drilling into concrete block on a test bench system. Method Three experiments were conducted on a test bench system to compare an electric (8.3â?¯kg) and pneumatic drill (8.6â?¯kg) on (1) noise and handle vibration, (2) respirable silica dust, and (3) drilling productivity. The test bench system repeatedly drilled 19â?¯mm diameter x 100â?¯mm depth holes into cured concrete block while the respective exposure levels were measured following ISO standards. Results Productivity levels were similar between the electric and the pneumatic drill (9.09â?¯mm/s vs. 8.69â?¯mm/s ROP; pâ?¯=â?¯0.15). However, peak noise (LPeak: 117.7 vs. 139.4 dBC; pâ?¯=â?¯0.001), weighted total handle vibration (ahw: 7.15 vs. 39.14â?¯m/s2; pâ?¯=â?¯0.002), and respirable silica dust levels (0.55 vs. 22.23â?¯mg/m3; pâ?¯=â?¯0.003) were significantly lower for the electric than the pneumatic drill. Discussion While there were no differences in drilling productivity between an electric and pneumatic drill of similar mass, there were substantial differences in exposure levels of noise, handle vibration, and respirable silica dust. Structural contractors should switch from pneumatic rock drills to electric rotary hammer drills for structural drilling into concrete in order to reduce worker exposures to the hazards of noise, hand vibration, and silica dust.","Masonry, Concrete, Hand-arm-vibration, Silicosis, Silica",David Rempel and Andrea Antonucci and Alan Barr and Michael R.

"Healthcare-associated infections are a serious worldwide health concern. Although contaminated medical devices are an avenue for infection, little research has evaluated the techniques used to open sterile packages. The goal of this study was to develop a method to quantify aspects of the package opening process in accordance with opening guidelines and then to demonstrate this methodology through a small sample of clinicians opening two sizes of pouch-style packages. Using motion capture techniques, a method was designed to quantify 11 parameters associated with the opening process. The method was then tested with nine healthcare professionals. Results indicated that all participants crossed the sterile field when opening packages. When opening large packages, participants spent significantly more time over the simulated sterile field and there was a trend towards more manipulations as compared to opening smaller packages.

"As the technical performance of products progresses, it is becoming more important to design products that satisfy customers' affective experiences. Hence, many studies about Kansei engineering or Kansei design have been conducted to develop products that can satisfy customers' affective experiences. In the Kansei design method, it is important to select affective variables related to the design elements of the product in order to accurately grasp the emotions of customers. Therefore, this study seeks to develop an affective variable extraction methodology that can reflect users' implicit needs effectively and efficiently. In this study, users' affective variables were extracted from online reviews and classified using a self-organizing map (SOM). For verification, the study selected the Amazon e-commerce service and performed a product experiment on recliners. The experimental results show that the most frequently used affective variable in the use of recliners is â??comfortâ??, which is related to various affective variables. In addition, 15 clusters for affective experiences of recliners extracted from Amazon.com were classified through the SOM. The findings suggest that text mining techniques and the SOM can be used to gather and analyze customers' affective experiences effectively and efficiently.

"Objective To compare people's ability to detect peripherally presented stimuli on a monocular head-worn display (HWD) versus a conventional screen. Background Visual attention capture has been systematically investigated, but not with respect to HWDs. How stimulus properties affect attention capture is likely to be different on an HWD when compared to a traditional computer display. Method Participants performed an ongoing perceptual task and attempted to detect stimuli that were displayed peripherally on either a computer monitor or a monocular HWD. Results Participants were less able to detect peripheral stimuli when the stimuli were presented on a HWD than when presented on a computer monitor. Moreover, the disadvantage of the HWD was more pronounced when peripheral stimuli were less distinct and when the stimuli were presented further into the periphery. Conclusion Presenting stimuli on a monocular head-worn display reduces participants' ability to notice peripheral visual stimuli compared to presentation on a normal computer monitor. This effect increases as stimuli are presented further in the periphery, but can be ameliorated to a degree by using high-contrast stimuli.

"This study demonstrates how big data analytics can improve automotive seat design practices pertaining to thigh support and cushion length, a consistent customer complaint across the automotive seating industry. The method featured an analysis of survey feedback (complaint and self-reported anthropometry) obtained from 92,258 buyers of new vehicles in the North American market. Driver seat three dimensional scans from 139 vehicles (representing 12 manufacturers) provided metrics related to cushion length allowing for determination of the percentage of an average occupant's thigh supported by an automotive seat cushion in relation to customer complaints. The range determined to provide thigh support leading to minimal complaints for overall cushion length is 83.46%â??88.49% and for cushion length to trim prominence is 73.63%â??80.60%. A specific vehicle program was used to confirm the targets established using big data analytics were effective in minimizing customer issues related to thigh support and cushion length.","Cushion length, Big data, Comfort",Megan Romelfanger and Michael Kolich,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018303326,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.08.020,0003-6870,2019,257--262,75,Applied Ergonomics,Comfortable automotive seat design and big data analytics: A study in thigh support,article,ROMELFANGER2019257
"Objective Compare the effectiveness of light, medium and heavy weight Police expandable batons from a performance and a user perception perspective. Rationale Police Officers are required to control combative individuals using less lethal tactics in proportion to the threat they face. Officers need to deliver sufficient force quickly and accurately. As such, it is important to select batons that are optimal for both performance and user experience. Methods Eleven active-duty New York Police Department Officers completed static and dynamic strike testing followed by a questionnaire. Six baton types were tested using different weights and lengths. Results Peak force, dynamic task speed and accuracy were similar between baton types. Peak impulse, forearm muscle activity, and discomfort were higher with the heaviest baton. Conclusions Lighter batons can deliver sufficient force to control assailants while imposing lower ergonomic costs and being preferable to the user with no impact on speed or accuracy.","Police, Baton, Less lethal",Alexander R.

"Working conditions of residential roofers expose them to a unique sloped environment. The purpose of this study is to determine in what way traversing across a sloped/roof surface alters lower extremity kinematics of the upslope and downslope legs compared to level walking. College aged males negotiated across a pitched (26 degrees) roof segment during which lower extremity three-dimensional kinematics were calculated. One foot was higher on the slope and one was lower for the duration of cross slope walking. Overall, cross-slope walking on a 26 degree roof significantly altered 77% of the measured lower extremity variables compared to level self-selected pace walking. The data suggest that roof pitch incite significant differences in crossslope walking of the kinematics in the lower extremity between the upslope and down slope limbs when compared to level surface walking. These alterations could temporarily alter proprioception which may in turn lead to increased falls and musculoskeletal injury, though further study is needed.","Kinematics, Lower Extremity, Roof, Cross-Slope",Scott P.

"Few studies have quantified the risk of musculoskeletal disorders during patient transfers in total assistance mode in real-life prehospital emergency care situations. An index to assess the overall risk of patient transfers was created; it makes it possible to quantify risk based on the patient's position and the height of the patient's location. An analysis of 71 transfers executed by paramedics in actual work situations showed that moving a patient from the ground was characterized by acute sagittal flexions and axial rotations, respectively, 42% and 12% of the time. When the patient was lying on a raised surface, the lifting index and perceived exertion were the lowest (2.55; easy). According to the overall risk index, patient transfers from the ground are the riskiest. Paramedics execute many risky lifts even in favorable patient handling contexts.","Emergency medical service (EMS), Patient transfers, Field study, Lifting, NIOSH lifting equation, Exposure variation analysis",Dominique Larouche and Marie Bellemare and JÃ©rÃ´me Prairie and Sandrine Hegg-Deloye and Philippe Corbeil,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018303454,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.08.029,0003-6870,2019,177--185,74,Applied Ergonomics,Overall risk index for patient transfers in total assistance mode executed by emergency medical technician-paramedics in real work situations,article,LAROUCHE2019177
"Work-related psychosocial hazards have substantial effects on risks of both musculoskeletal and mental health disorders (MSDs, MHDs). Recent Australian research on workplace risk management practices in 19 work organisations found that risks from work-related psychosocial hazards were poorly managed. This study identified factors impeding better management of MSD and MHD risks within those organisations. Method Interviews were conducted with staff from residential aged care and logistics/transport organisations in Australia. Transcripts were analysed using a worker-centred systems framework. Results and conclusions Many barriers to more effective risk management were identified. Most fundamentally, few people knew of the need to manage MSD risk arising from work-related psychosocial hazards, and OHS-related skills of key managers were often reported as inadequate, particularly concerning management of risk from psychosocial hazards. Also, funding and staffing levels were often reported as problematic, and OHS issues were seen as lower priority than accreditation and commercial requirements.","Musculoskeletal, Mental health, Occupational health and safety (OHS), Psychosocial hazards, Risk management",Jodi Oakman and Wendy Macdonald and Natasha Kinsman,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018305234,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.10.007,0003-6870,2019,184--192,75,Applied Ergonomics,Barriers to more effective prevention of work-related musculoskeletal and mental health disorders,article,OAKMAN2019184
"Sit-stand tables are introduced in offices to increase variation in gross body posture, but the extent to which upper body posture variation is also affected has not previously been addressed. Neck, trunk, and upper arm postures (means and minute-to-minute variances) were determined during periods of sitting and standing from 24 office workers using sit-stand tables to perform computer work. Posture variability resulting from different temporal compositions of sitting and standing computer work was then predicted for the neck, trunk and upper arm by simulations. Postural variability during computer work could be increased up to three-fold when 20â??60% of the work was performed standing (i.e. 40â??80% performed sitting), compared to performing computer work only sitting. The exact composition of sit-stand proportions leading to maximum variability, as well as the potential size of the increase in variability, differed considerably between workers. Guidelines for sit-stand table use should note these large inter-individual differences.","Office work, Adjustable table, Posture variation, Job variance ratio (JVR), Sedentary behaviors",Dechristian FranÃ§a Barbieri and Divya Srinivasan and Svend Erik Mathiassen and Ana Beatriz Oliveira,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018304265,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.09.012,0003-6870,2019,120--128,75,Applied Ergonomics,"Variation in upper extremity, neck and trunk postures when performing computer work at a sit-stand station",article,BARBIERI2019120
"Active and sports fashion in the high-end market focuses on fit, superior comfort and functional performance for various end-uses. However, the engineering design of sports gloves in relation to hand anthropometry measurements remains unclear. In this study, two types of ready-to-wear sport gloves, namely, war-gaming glove and hiking glove were purchased from the market. The glove dimensions, fabrication properties and the effect of glove fit on hand and finger dexterity were investigated. Thirty female individuals (20â??29 years old) participated a series of hand performance tests and subjective perception rating assessments towards the gloves. Results indicated that the active range of motion of fingers, finger tactile sensitivity, gripping strength and ability to handle pegs and marbles decreased with the use of gloves compared with bare hands. The perceptions of comfort and ease of hand motions decreased with the increased of wear time. The glove fit in terms of finger length dimensions was significantly correlated with hand grip force. The glove fit in hand, wrist and finger circumference dimensions had significant impact on the ability to handle small objects. It is suggested that hand length, hand circumference, finger circumference and the ratio of finger length to palm length should be considered in the design and development of gloves to improve hand performance and comfort.","Hand/glove dimensions, Material properties, Hand dexterity, Subjective perception, Wearing comfort",A.

"Mobile phone use is known to be associated with musculoskeletal pain in the neck and upper extremities because of related physical risk factors, including awkward postures. A chair that provides adequate support (armrests and back support) may reduce biomechanical loading in the neck and shoulder regions. Therefore, we conducted a repeated-measures laboratory study with 20 participants (23â?¯Â±â?¯1.9 years; 10 males) to determine whether armrests and back support during mobile phone use reduced head/neck flexion, gravitational moment, and muscle activity in the neck and shoulder regions. The results showed that the chair support (armrests and back support) reduced head/neck flexion (pâ?¯<â?¯0.001), gravitational moment (pâ?¯<â?¯0.001), and muscle activity (pâ?¯<â?¯0.01) in the neck and shoulder regions significantly compared to no chair support.

"The impact of manual material handling such as lifting, lowering, pushing, pulling and awkward postures have been studied, and models using these external demands to assess risk of injury have been developed and employed by safety and health professionals. However, ergonomic models incorporating personal characteristics into a comprehensive model are lacking. This study explores the utility of adding personal characteristics such as the estimated L5/S1 Intervertebral Disc (IVD) cross-sectional area, age, gender and Body Mass Index to the Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE) with the goal to improve risk assessment. A dataset with known RNLE Cumulative Lifting Indices (CLIs) and related health outcomes was used to evaluate the impact of personal characteristics on RNLE performance. The dataset included 29 cases and 101 controls selected from a cohort of 1022 subjects performing 667 jobs. RNLE risk assessment was improved by incorporation of personal characteristics. Adding gender and intervertebral disc size multipliers to the RNLE raised the odds ratio for a CLI of 3.0 from 6.71 (CI: 2.2â??20.9) to 24.75 (CI: 2.8â??215.4). Similarly, performance was either unchanged or improved when some existing multipliers were removed. The most promising RNLE change involved incorporation of a multiplier based on the estimated IVD cross-sectional area (CSA). Results are promising, but confidence intervals are broad and additional, prospective research is warranted to validate findings.","Revised NIOSH lifting equation (RNLE), Personal characteristics, BMI, Age, Gender, Low back pain, Intervertebral disc cross sectional area, L5/S1, Risk assessment",Menekse Salar Barim and Richard F.

"The aim of this work is to define a new method that helps researchers to analyze perceptions of (dis)comfort in dynamic conditions. Recent studies pay considerable attention to body movements, mobility, and stability to measure comfort or discomfort when seated. Most of these discuss the relations between subjective comfort/discomfort and objective measurements (e.g. body pressure distribution, body movement and EMG) for short- and medium-term sitting. The present analysis took place in a classroom of the Industrial Engineering Department at the University of Salerno. The participants included 25 students (12 females and 13 males), who were observed during classroom hours. The students were invited to sit at a combo-desk and were free to perform different combinations of movements while writing and listening. These activities required that they adapt their body movements, as the combo-desk was fixed to the floor. A pressure pad was used to detect pressure at interface and center of pressure's changes, allowing for the bodies' motion data to be recorded. The aim was to identify the correct threshold to be used for movement detection and to investigate correlations between the number of movements and the perceived (dis)comfort. The study also identifies those body parts that have the greatest effect on (dis)comfort perception.","Comfort, Discomfort, Center of pressure, Pressure map, Body movements, Classroom seat, School furniture",Luisa Fasulo and Alessandro Naddeo and Nicola Cappetti,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018303338,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.08.021,0003-6870,2019,233--240,74,Applied Ergonomics,"A study of classroom seat (dis)comfort: Relationships between body movements, center of pressure on the seat, and lower limbs' sensations",article,FASULO2019233
"Although the workstations of a Brazilian automotive electrical harness production line are set close to TAKT time (the production rate required to meet demand), factory performance is compromised regarding: (i) sick leaves due to occupational disease (105 employees last year) and (ii) a production rate at only 42% of capacity. Our objective was to simulate the performance of a production line balanced against physical overload by the addition of an extra workstation. Based on ergonomic work analysis, the study applied System Dynamics at the global observation stage to obtain a systemic interpretation of the factors involved in production line performance. According to the indicators, the alternative configuration reduced physical overload by 36%, which would result in a sick leave rate of 50.8 employees/year (51.6% lower than the current configuration), as well as a production rate at 99% of capacity (a 92.7% increase over the current configuration). We found that reducing physical overload allows the â??workforce controlâ? loop to govern the system, producing favorable results. We conclude that setting the work cycle overly close to TAKT time leads to overload, due to the shorter recovery times at the end of each cycle. Thus, it is necessary to seek a balance between efficiency gains through downtime reduction and the physiological recovery of workers.","Physical overload, System dynamics, Ergonomics, Human factors, Production line balance",Diego Luiz de Mattos and Rafael {Ariente Neto} and Eugenio AndrÃ©s DÃ­az Merino and Fernando AntÃ´nio Forcellini,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018302369,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.08.001,0003-6870,2019,107--121,79,Applied Ergonomics,Simulating the influence of physical overload on assembly line performance: A case study in an automotive electrical component plant,article,MATTOS2019107
"Physical inactivity, a primary cause of most chronic diseases, has been associated with low levels of physical activity enjoyment. Physical activity enjoyment can be impacted by an individual's experience with exercise equipment. The purpose of this study was to adopt a user-centred approach to determine the relationship between physical activity enjoyment and functionality and usability of four treadmills. A running protocol was completed by 57 trained runners (41 male) on four treadmills. Runners reported enjoyment levels as well as their perceptions about treadmill running surface, controls, safety and stability, physical interaction, learnability of data console and aesthetic appeal. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed significant differences between the treadmills for each variable. Multiple regression analysis reported aesthetic appeal significantly predicted enjoyment of use. Results suggest that adopting a user-centred approach to compare exercise equipment usability and features can correlate with enjoyment and further impact on physical activity adherence.","Analysis and evaluation, Exercise equipment, User-centred approach, Usability testing and evaluation",Attilio Carraro and Catherine A.

"The present study investigated the role of working memory capacity (WMC) in predicting distracted driving performance using a working memory distractor. Forty-nine participants (including one with missing data) completed four working memory complex spans prior to completing a distracted and non-distracted simulated driving trial. During the distracted driving trial, participants drove while simultaneously completing the grocery list task (GLT), a semi-naturalistic working memory task developed by the authors. Results showed that participants were significantly slower at braking when a yellow traffic light appeared and during sudden braking events when distracted. Furthermore, the impairing effect of distraction on braking response time was partially mediated by WMC. There was also a trend towards a moderating effect of WMC, where the impairing effect of distraction was more pronounced for individuals with low WMC than high WMC. Theoretical and practical implications for the role of individual differences in cognition and driving, in-vehicle devices use and traffic safety, as well as semi-autonomous vehicle design are also discussed.","Working memory capacity, Driver cognition, Driver behavior, Distracted driving, Traffic safety",Jennifer F.

This study evaluated the identification performance of a set of tactile symbols used in public environments for the visually impaired. A questionnaire survey was carried out to investigate the public environment needs from 60 visually impaired associations. A two-stage experiment with a matching test was then conducted to explore the identification efficiency of graphic tactile public information symbols. Eighty-one students were recruited as participants from a school for the visually impaired. The survey results show that fourteen public buildings were frequently visited and ten architectural elements were mostly needed by the visually impaired. The experimental results showed the correct response of graphic symbols tested in both two-stage experiments could meet the identification criterion of 90% and even better except for the escalator/elevator with 87.0% in the second stage.

"This study investigated how task demands affect postural behaviour during standing. Twenty-four participants completed three different 12-min tasks: (1) a cognitive task that involved answering questions based on a written passage; (2) a light manual assembly task; and (3) standing quietly with no secondary task. The manual task was associated with the lowest amount of postural movement and a more static pose than the other two conditions. Specifically, postural variability of the lumbar (Fâ?¯=â?¯5.8; pâ?¯=â?¯0.01) and thoracic (Fâ?¯=â?¯4.2; pâ?¯=â?¯0.03) spine, and fidgets and shifts of the spine (Fâ?¯=â?¯3.2; pâ?¯=â?¯0.048), were lowest in the manual task. Additionally, individuals perceiving tasks to be more demandingâ??regardless of task typeâ??tended to move less (pâ?¯=â?¯0.049) than those perceiving lower demands.

"Neck and shoulder disorders are a considerable health problem amongst frequent microscope users. We aimed to investigate the neck and shoulder discomfort experienced during prolonged microscopic activity and to assess the benefits of minibreaks. A prospective crossover study was performed on 17 healthy volunteers sitting still while looking down a bench with and without the Ipswich Microbreak Technique (IMT). We used a subjective measure of time to fatigue and pain in the neck and shoulder regions as well as objective readings from a surface electromyogram (sEMG). The IMT delayed the sensation of pain in the neck and shoulder region while reducing the overall sEMG muscle activation. In conclusion, IMT is a useful strategy in reducing and delaying the pain in neck and shoulder from prolonged working under the microscope.

Anticipated or expected benefits were assessed, in terms of perceived discomfort, shoulder muscle activity, and task performance. Using the exoskeletal vest did not substantially influence perceived discomfort, but did decrease normalized shoulder muscle activity levels (e.g., â?¤Â 45% reduction in peak activity). Drilling task completion time decreased by nearly 20% with the vest, but the number of errors increased.

"Aim This study investigated and compared the associations between self-reported exposures to individual as well as work-related physical and psychosocial risk factors for musculoskeletal (MS) disorders and the prevalence of MS symptoms in different body areas among short- (P&D) and long-distance (Bulk delivery) truck drivers working for the same large gas delivery company in Canada. Methods 123 truck drivers nationwide participated in this questionnaire-based cross-sectional study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results 43.1% of drivers reported MS pain in at least one body area over the past 12 months and 26.8% over the past 7 days. Bulk drivers had a significantly higher prevalence of MS pain than P&D drivers for both periods. When P&D and Bulk drivers were pooled together, belonging to the Bulk subgroup emerged as the strongest factor for low back pain (ORâ?¯=â?¯8.45, pâ?¯=â?¯0.002), for shoulder pain (ORâ?¯=â?¯3.70, pâ?¯=â?¯0.027) and for MS pain in any body area (ORâ?¯=â?¯4.05, pâ?¯=â?¯0.006). In Bulk drivers ""High effort-reward imbalance"" was strongly associated with MS pain in any body area (ORâ?¯=â?¯6.47, pâ?¯=â?¯0.01), with shoulder pain (ORâ?¯=â?¯4.95, pâ?¯=â?¯0.016), and with low back pain (ORâ?¯=â?¯4.51, pâ?¯=â?¯0.02). In P&D drivers MS pain in any body area was strongly associated with ""Working with hands above shoulders"" (ORâ?¯=â?¯6.58, pâ?¯=â?¯0.009) and ""Whole-body vibration"" (ORâ?¯=â?¯5.48, pâ?¯=â?¯0.018), while shoulder pain was strongly associated with ""Hand-arm vibration"" (ORâ?¯=â?¯7.27, pâ?¯=â?¯0.041). Conclusions Prevalence of MS pain was higher among industrial gas delivery truck drivers than in the general Quebec male worker population, and higher for Bulk drivers compared to P&D drivers. MS pain in Bulk drivers was mainly associated with psychosocial risk factors and lifestyle; MS pain in P&D drivers was mainly associated with physical risk factors.","Musculoskeletal pain, Musculoskeletal risk factors, Self-reports, Professional truck drivers",Firdaous Sekkay and Daniel Imbeau and Yuvin Chinniah and Philippe-Antoine DubÃ© and Nathalie {de Marcellis-Warin} and Nancy Beauregard and Martin TrÃ©panier,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018301285,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.05.005,0003-6870,2018,69--87,72,Applied Ergonomics,Risk factors associated with self-reported musculoskeletal pain among short and long distance industrial gas delivery truck drivers,article,SEKKAY201869
"Manual lifting of loads arises in many occupations as well as in activities of daily living. Prior studies explore lifting biomechanics and conditions implicated in lifting-induced injuries through laboratory-based experimental methods. This study introduces a new measurement method using load-embedded inertial measurement units (IMUs) to evaluate lifting tasks in varied environments outside of the laboratory. An example vertical load lifting task is considered that is included in an outdoor obstacle course. The IMU data, in the form of the load acceleration and angular velocity, is used to estimate load vertical velocity and three lifting performance metrics: the lifting time (speed), power, and motion smoothness. Large qualitative differences in these parameters distinguish exemplar high and low performance trials. These differences are further supported by subsequent statistical analyses of twenty three trials (including a total of 115 total lift/lower cycles) from fourteen healthy participants. Results reveal that lifting time is strongly correlated with lifting power (as expected) but also correlated with motion smoothness. Thus, participants who lift rapidly do so with significantly greater power using motions that minimize motion jerk.","Manual load lifting, Performance, Inertial sensors, Biomechanics",Aditya Tammana and Cody McKay and Stephen M.

"Although work in complex socio-technical systems needs support from several â??resources for actionâ?, the interactions between these are not usually managed systematically. This study introduces a six-step framework for analyzing the interactions between two key resources for action, namely the use of standardized operating procedures and resilience skills (RSs). The main steps for applying the framework involve: (i) a content analysis of the procedure, which allows for the identification of underspecified rules and situations that could be emphasized in scenario-based training focused on developing RSs; and (ii) the identification of factors that set the stage for the emergence of RSs, which could be accounted for by procedures and the broader work system design. An application of the framework is presented in the preparation and administration of intravenous medications in an emergency department. Data collection involved 98â?¯h of observations, 14 interviews, and document analysis. Based on this field study, a model of the interactions between procedures and RSs is proposed as well as the lessons learned from applying the framework are discussed.","Procedures, Resilience skills, Resources for action, Preparation and administration of medications",Priscila Wachs and Tarcisio Abreu Saurin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701730279X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.12.013,0003-6870,2018,328--337,68,Applied Ergonomics,Modelling interactions between procedures and resilience skills,article,WACHS2018328
"Human performance modeling is a core topic in ergonomics. In addition to deriving models, it is important to verify the kinds of tasks that can be modeled. Drury's law is promising for path tracking tasks such as navigating a path with pens or driving a car. We conducted an experiment based on the observation that paper-cutting tasks using scissors resemble such tasks. The results showed that cutting arc-like paths (1/4 of a circle) showed an excellent fit with Drury's law (R2â?¯>â?¯0.98), whereas cutting linear paths showed a worse fit (R2â?¯>â?¯0.87). Since linear paths yielded better fits when path amplitudes were divided (R2â?¯>â?¯0.99 for all amplitudes), we discuss the characteristics of paper-cutting operations using scissors.","Drury's law, Human motor performance, Paper-cutting tasks",Shota Yamanaka and Homei Miyashita,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302843,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.12.018,0003-6870,2018,32--39,69,Applied Ergonomics,Paper-cutting operations using scissors in Drury's law tasks,article,YAMANAKA201832
"Measuring the available coefficient of friction (ACOF) of a shoe-floor interface is influenced by the choice of normal force, shoe-floor angle and sliding speed. The purpose of this study was to quantify the quality of slip prediction models based on ACOF values measured across different testing conditions. A dynamic ACOF measurement device that tests entire footwear specimens (Portable Slip Simulator) was used. The ACOF was measured for nine different footwear-contaminant combinations with two levels of normal force, sliding speed and shoe-floor angle. These footwear-contaminant combinations were also used in human gait studies to quantify the required coefficient of friction (RCOF) and slip outcomes. The results showed that test conditions significantly influenced ACOF. The condition that best predicted slip risk during the gait studies was 250â?¯N normal force, 17Â° shoe-floor angle, 0.5â?¯m/s sliding speed. These findings can inform footwear slip-resistance measurement methods to improve design and prevent slips.","Slip and fall accidents, Coefficient of friction, Footwear",Arian Iraqi and RakiÃ© Cham and Mark S.

"There is growing awareness of the limitations of current practice regarding the investigation of patient safety incidents, including a reliance on Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and a lack of safety expertise. Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) can offer safety expertise and systemic approaches to incident analysis. However, HFE is underutilised in healthcare. This study aims to explore the integration of HFE systemic accident analysis into current practice. The study compares the processes and outputs of a current practice RCA-based incident analysis and a Systems Theoretic Accident Modelling and Processes (STAMP) analysis on the same medication error incident. The STAMP analysis was undertaken by two HFE researchers with the participation of twenty-one healthcare stakeholders. The STAMP-based approach guided healthcare stakeholders towards consideration of system design issues and remedial actions, going beyond the individualâ??based remedial actions proposed by the RCA.

"The current study analyzed 312 caught-in-between fatalities caused by machinery and vehicles. A comprehensive and mutually exclusive coding scheme was developed to analyze and code each caught-in-between fatality in terms of age, gender, experience of the victim, type of industry, source of injury, and causes for these accidents. Boolean algebra analysis was applied on these 312 caught-in-between fatalities to derive minimal cut set (MCS) causes associated with each source of injury. Eventually, contributing factors and common accident patterns associated with (1) special process machinery including textile, printing, packaging machinery, (2) metal, woodworking, and special material machinery, (3) conveyor, (4) vehicle, (5) crane, (6) construction machinery, and (7) elevator can be divided into three major groups through Boolean algebra and MCS analysis. The MCS causes associated with conveyor share the same primary causes as those of the special process machinery including textile, printing, packaging and metal, woodworking, and special material machinery. These fatalities can be eliminated by focusing on the prevention measures associated with lack of safeguards, working on a running machine or process, unintentional activation, unsafe posture or position, unsafe clothing, and defective safeguards. Other precise and effective intervention can be developed based on the identified groups of accident causes associated with each source of injury.","Fault tree, Boolean algebra, Minimum cut set (MCS)",Chia-Fen Chi and Syuan-Zih Lin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302727,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.12.007,0003-6870,2018,338--348,68,Applied Ergonomics,Classification scheme and prevention measures for caught-in-between occupational fatalities,article,CHI2018338
"The objectives were 1) to design and produce two novel unpadded bicycle saddles with a wide/medium width and partial nose cutout; 2) to investigate the responses on pressure distribution and perceived discomfort in female cyclists. For comparison, a standard saddle was also tested. Nineteen female cyclists pedaled on an ergometer cycle for 20â?¯min with each saddle in a counterbalanced order. A pressure mat measured saddle interface pressure. Discomfort ratings were collected using a visual analogue scale. Total mean saddle pressure remained similar across saddles. The wide saddle increased anterior and decreased posterior mean saddle pressure as compared with the standard (pâ?¯<â?¯.002) and the medium saddle (pâ?¯<â?¯.001). Significantly increased ischial tuberosity discomfort was found for the novel saddles (pâ?¯<â?¯.001), while crotch discomfort was not significantly different between saddles. The medium width saddle appeared to be the best compromise since increased crotch discomfort was avoided and saddle pressures were redistributed. Such design may be suggested as an alternative to traditional saddles for women reporting discomfort in the perineal region.","Bicycling, Discomfort, Gender, Saddle design, Variability",Anna Sofie Larsen and Frederik G.

"This study aims to develop a motion sickness measurement index in a virtual reality (VR) environment. The VR market is in an early stage of market formation and technological development, and thus, research on the side effects of VR devices such as simulator motion sickness is lacking. In this study, we used the simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ), which has been traditionally used for simulator motion sickness measurement. To measure the motion sickness in a VR environment, 24 users performed target selection tasks using a VR device. The SSQ was administered immediately after each task, and the order of work was determined using the Latin square design. The existing SSQ was revised to develop a VR sickness questionnaire, which is used as the measurement index in a VR environment. In addition, the target selection method and button size were found to be significant factors that affect motion sickness in a VR environment. The results of this study are expected to be used for measuring and designing simulator sickness using VR devices in future studies.","Virtual reality, Motion sickness, Simulator sickness questionnaire",Hyun K.

"Although lean production (LP) has been increasingly adopted in healthcare systems, its benefits often fall short of expectations. This might be partially due to the failure of lean to account for the complexity of healthcare. This paper discusses the joint use of principles of LP and resilience engineering (RE), which is an approach for system design inspired by complexity science. Thus, a framework for supporting the design of socio-technical systems, which combines insights from LP and RE, was developed and tested in a system involving a patient flow from an emergency department to an intensive care unit. Based on this empirical study, as well as on extant theory, eight design propositions that support the framework application were developed. Both the framework and its corresponding propositions can contribute to the design of socio-technical systems that are at the same time safe and efficient.","Resilience engineering, Lean production, Healthcare, Emergency department, Design science research",Caroline Brum Rosso and Tarcisio Abreu Saurin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300905,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.04.004,0003-6870,2018,45--56,71,Applied Ergonomics,The joint use of resilience engineering and lean production for work system design: A study in healthcare,article,ROSSO201845
"This study aimed to identify a pre-cooling method to reduce the physiological and perceptual strain, and the inflammatory response, experienced by individuals who wear personal protective equipment. Eleven males (age 20â?¯Â±â?¯2 years, weight 75.8â?¯Â±â?¯9.3â?¯kg, height 177.1â?¯Â±â?¯5.0â?¯cm) completed 15min pre-cooling (phase change vest [PCV], forearm cooling [ARM], ice slurry consumption [ICE], or a no cooling control [CON]) and 45min intermittent walk (4â?¯â?¯kmâ?¯hâ??1, 1% gradient) in 49.5â?¯Â±â?¯0.6â?¯Â°C and 15.4â?¯Â±â?¯1.0% RH, whilst wearing firefighter ensemble.

"Very little is known about people's ability to localize sound under varying workload conditions, though it would be expected that increasing workload should degrade performance. A set of eight auditory clinical alarms already known to have relatively high localizability (the ease with which their location is identified) when tested alone were tested in six conditions where workload was varied. Participants were required to indicate the location of a series of alarms emanating at random from one of eight speaker locations. Additionally, they were asked to read, carry out mental arithmetic tasks, be exposed to typical ICU noise, or carry out either the reading task or the mental arithmetic task in ICU noise. Performance in the localizability task was best in the control condition (no secondary task) and worst in those tasks which involved both a secondary task and noise. The data does therefore demonstrate the typical pattern of increasing workload affecting a primary task in an area where there is little data. In addition, the data demonstrates that performance in the control condition results in a missed alarm on one in ten occurrences, whereas performance in the heaviest workload conditions results in a missed alarm on every fourth occurrence. This finding has implications for the understanding of both â??inattentional deafnessâ?? and â??alarm fatigueâ?? in clinical environments.","Auditory alarms, Clinical alarms, Clinical safety, Patient safety, Auditory processes, Alarm fatigue",Judy Edworthy and Scott Reid and Katie Peel and Samantha Lock and Jessica Williams and Chloe Newbury and Joseph Foster and Martin Farrington,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018301297,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.05.006,0003-6870,2018,88--93,72,Applied Ergonomics,The impact of workload on the ability to localize audible alarms,article,EDWORTHY201888
"The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of error consequence, as reward or punishment, on individualsâ?? checking behaviour following data entry. This study comprised two eye-tracking experiments that replicate and extend the investigation of Li et al. (2016) into the effect of monetary reward and punishment on data-entry performance. The first experiment adopted the same experimental setup as Li et al. (2016) but additionally used an eye tracker. The experiment validated Li et al. (2016) finding that, when compared to no error consequence, both reward and punishment led to improved data-entry performance in terms of reducing errors, and that no performance difference was found between reward and punishment. The second experiment extended the earlier study by associating error consequence to each individual trial by providing immediate performance feedback to participants. It was found that gradual increment (i.e. reward feedback) also led to significantly more accurate performance than no error consequence. It is unclear whether gradual increment is more effective than gradual decrement because of the small sample size tested. However, this study reasserts the effectiveness of reward on data-entry performance.","Error, Reward, Punishment, Data-entry, Eye-tracking",Simon Y.W. Li and Anna L.

"Motion sickness is thought to occur when the brain's assumptions about incoming sensory information do not match the actual signals received. These signals must involve the vestibular system for motion sickness to occur. In this paper, we describe an experiment in which subjects experienced unexpected visual motions, or perturbations, as they navigated a virtual environment (VE) while standing and wearing a head mounted display (HMD) or while viewing a monitor. We found that postural instability, as measured by a balance board, increased with time only when perturbations were present. HMD users exhibited greater sway when exposed to visual perturbations than did monitor users. Yet motion sickness increased only when an HMD was used and occurred with or without participants undergoing perturbations. These results suggest that the postural instability which is generated by unexpected visual perturbation does not necessarily increase the likelihood of motion sickness in a virtual environment.","Virtual reality, Motion sickness, Postural instability",Mark Dennison and Michael D'Zmura,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300760,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.03.015,0003-6870,2018,9--16,71,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of unexpected visual motion on postural sway and motion sickness,article,DENNISON20189
"One of the most common causes of injuries among firefighters is slips, trips, and falls on the fireground. Acute fatigue from firefighting activities and/or carrying asymmetric loads might impact gait characteristics increasing slip, trip, and fall risk. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of fatigue from simulated firefighting activities and carrying asymmetric loads (fire hose over one shoulder) on firefightersâ?? gait behavior. Both firefighting activities and asymmetric hoseload carriage led to shorter step lengths, stride lengths, single leg support time, and longer double leg support time, suggesting firefighters adopted cautious gait strategies. Simulated firefighting activities performed in either a live-fire training tower or laboratory-based environmental chamber using a firefighting activity simulator resulted in nearly identical effects on gait kinematics. This result suggests that gait assessment in a laboratory-based environmental chamber can be used as effective simulations in place of specialized burn facilities.","Gait parameters, Firefighting activities, Load carriage, Firefighters",Kiwon Park and Julian F.

"Research has demonstrated that a better-fitted bicycle helmet offers improved protection to the rider during an impact. Nowadays, bicycle helmets in the market that range in size from small/medium to medium/large might not fit the diverse range of human head shapes and dimensions. 3D scanning was used to create 3D head shape databases of 20 participants who volunteered for the study. We developed new custom-fitted helmet inner liners, based on the 3D head shape of two sub-groups of participants, to map their head sizes and contours closely to the conventional Medium (M) and Large (L) sizes as described in from AS/NZS 2512.1: 2009.

"Introduction As sports systems become increasingly more complex, competitive, and technology-centric, there is a greater need for systems ergonomics methods to consider the performance, health, and safety of athletes in context with the wider settings in which they operate. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review was to identify and critically evaluate studies which have applied a systems ergonomics research approach in the context of sports performance and injury management. Material and methods Five databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus) were searched for the dates 01 January 1990 to 01 August 2017, inclusive, for original peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers. Reported analyses were underpinned by a recognised systems ergonomics method, and study aims were related to the optimisation of sports performance (e.g. communication, playing style, technique, tactics, or equipment), and/or the management of sports injury (i.e. identification, prevention, or treatment). Results A total of seven articles were identified. Two articles were focussed on understanding and optimising sports performance, whereas five examined sports injury management. The methods used were the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork, Cognitive Work Analysis (the Work Domain Analysis Abstraction Hierarchy), Rasmussen's Risk Management Framework, and the Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Processes method. The individual sport application was distance running, whereas the team sports contexts examined were cycling, football, Australian Football League, and rugby union. Conclusions The included systems ergonomics applications were highly flexible, covering both amateur and elite sports contexts. The studies were rated as valuable, providing descriptions of injury controls and causation, the factors influencing injury management, the allocation of responsibilities for injury prevention, as well as the factors and their interactions underpinning sports performance.

Using an established antecedent-behavior-consequence (A-B-C) taxonomy, reports were analyzed by context, officer behavior, type of firearm, injuries, deaths, and property damages. This study is the first to empirically document reports of UDs caused by the startle response and the first to analyze a substantial sample of UDs that involved handguns with a double-action only trigger mechanism. An expanded analysis of UD consequences suggested that deaths and injuries might be more prevalent than previously reported.","Accidental discharge, Firearm, Law enforcement, Negligent discharge, Unintentional discharge",John O'Neill and Mark E.

"This study aimed to compare thumb kinematics and upper limb muscle activity, and the influence of hand size, when texting on a keypad smartphone and a touchscreen smartphone. Furthermore, the study compared exertion, discomfort, and performance when texting on the two phones.

When texting on the touchscreen phone compared to the keypad phone thumb flexion (pâ?¯=â?¯0.008) and flexion/extension range of motion were smaller (pâ?¯=â?¯0.02), the thumb was on average less internally rotated (pâ?¯=â?¯0.02), and activity (50th and 90th percentile) of the thumb and forearm muscles was lower (pâ?¯â?¤â?¯0.05). The differences in thumb flexion were found only in the group with shorter hands and the differences in muscle activity was found only in the group with longer hands. These findings suggest there are differences in risks for developing musculoskeletal disorders during smartphone use with different key activation mechanisms and different hand sizes.","Smartphones, Hand size, EMG",Ewa Gustafsson and Pieter Coenen and Amity Campbell and Leon Straker,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300644,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.03.003,0003-6870,2018,232--239,70,Applied Ergonomics,"Texting with touchscreen and keypad phones - A comparison of thumb kinematics, upper limb muscle activity, exertion, discomfort, and performance",article,GUSTAFSSON2018232
"Objective To assess uncertainty in cost estimates for collecting posture data by inclinometry, observations and self-report. Method In a study addressing physical workloads at a paper mill, costs were calculated for measuring postures of twenty-eight workers during three shifts. Uncertainty in costs was assessed for all three methods as the range between an assumed best case (lowest cost) and worst case (highest cost) using scenario analysis. Results The cost for observation was larger, but also more uncertain (â?¬16506 and â?¬89552 in the best and worst case, respectively) than that of inclinometry (â?¬7613 - â?¬45896). Self-report costs were both lower and less uncertain (â?¬3743 - â?¬23368). Conclusions The extent of uncertainty in cost estimates implies that observation could be less expensive than inclinometry, e.g., in a scenario where experienced observers could use existing software, while inclinometers would have to be purchased. We propose adding uncertainty assessments to cost estimates when selecting a method for measuring working postures, and offer guidance in how to proceed in a specific setting.","Cost components, Scenario analysis, Exposure assessment",Amanda {Waleh Ã?strÃ¶m} and Marina Heiden and Svend Erik Mathiassen and Annika StrÃ¶mberg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300917,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.04.005,0003-6870,2018,73--77,71,Applied Ergonomics,"Uncertainty in monetary cost estimates for assessing working postures using inclinometry, observation or self-report",article,WALEHASTROM201873
"Operator trust in automation is a crucial factor influencing its use and operational performance. However, the relationship between automation trust and performance remains poorly understood and requires further investigation. The objective of this paper is to explore the difference in trust and performance on automation-aided spacecraft rendezvous and docking (RVD) between the novice and the expert and to investigate the relationship between automation trust and performance as well. We employed a two-factor mixed design, with training skill (novice and expert) and automation mode (manual RVD and automation aided RVD) serving as the two factors. Twenty participants, 10 novices and 10 experts, were recruited to conduct six RVD tasks for two automation levels. After the tasks, operator performance was recorded by the desktop hand-held docking training equipment. Operator trust was also measured by a 12-items questionnaire at the beginning and end of each trial. As a result, automation narrowed the performance gap significantly between the novice and the expert, and the automation trust showed a marginally significant difference between the novice and the expert. Furthermore, the result demonstrated that the attitude angle control error of the expert was related to the total trust score, whereas other automation performance indicators were not related to the total score of trust. However, automation performance was related to the dimensions of trust, such as entrust, harmful, and dependable.","Automation aided, Automation trust, Automation performance, Spacecraft rendezvous and docking (RVD)",Jianwei Niu and He Geng and Yijing Zhang and Xiaoping Du,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300759,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.03.014,0003-6870,2018,1--8,71,Applied Ergonomics,Relationship between automation trust and operator performance for the novice and expert in spacecraft rendezvous and docking (RVD),article,NIU20181
"Surgeons work in awkward work postures and have high precision demands - well-known risk factors for musculoskeletal pain. Robotic-assisted laparoscopy is expected to be less demanding compared to conventional laparoscopy; however, studies indicate that robotic-assisted laparoscopy is also associated with poor ergonomics and musculoskeletal pain. The ergonomic condition in the robotic console is partially dependent upon the chair provided, which often is a regular office chair. Our study quantified and compared the muscular load during robotic-assisted laparoscopy using one of two custom built ergonomic chairs and a regular office chair. The results demonstrated no differences that could be considered clinically relevant. Overall, the study showed high levels of static and mean muscular activity, increased perceived physical exertion from pre-to-post surgery, and moderate to high risk for musculoskeletal injuries measured by the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment worksheet. Authors advocate for further investigation in surgeonsâ?? ergonomics and physical work demands in robotic surgery.","Robotic-assisted laparoscopy, Ergonomics, Electromyography",T. Dalager and P.T.

"Cordless stick vacuum cleaners on the market have two distinctive styles. One with the center of mass (CoM) near user's hand and the other with the CoM near the brush. The main objective of this study was to determine whether the CoM would affect the muscle activities of upper extremity during floor vacuuming. Twenty-four participants conducted floor vacuuming strokes on carpeted floor and tiled floor at two different speeds with a 2.57â?¯kg stick cleaner model with the CoM near its handle and near its brush. The 50th %-ile muscle activities ranged from 5.4% to 16.3% of the maximum activity level (mild to moderate intensity), with significantly greater activities (pâ?¯<â?¯0.05) when vacuuming with the high CoM model.

"Workers with low back pain (LBP) may benefit from wearing a lumbar belt (LB), but the biomechanical and psychological mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Two types of flexible LB (extensible and non-extensible) were compared to a control condition (no LB) regarding pain-related (pain, fear of pain and catastrophizing) and biomechanical (range of motion â?? ROM) outcomes related to two tasks: maximal trunk flexion-extension and manual material handling. Healthy controls and participants with LBP were tested. During both tasks, the two LBs reduced the lumbar ROM in participants with LBP in the same way as healthy controls. This was observed even at the beginning of the trunk flexion movement, allowing generalization to many work tasks, that is to say tasks performed with small or deep trunk flexion. The two LBs reduced pain, fear of pain and catastrophizing in subjects with LBP. That may help a gradual re-exposure to physical work activities (disability prevention perspective), or maintaining these activities (secondary prevention perspective), following a LBP episode.","Low back pain, Range of motion, Fear of pain",Ali Shahvarpour and Richard Preuss and Michael J.L.

"As mining vehicle operators are exposed to high level of Whole body vibration (WBV) for prolonged periods of time, approaches to reduce this exposure are needed for the specific types of exposures in mining. Although various engineering controls (i.e. seat suspension systems) have been developed to address WBV, there has been lack of research to systematically evaluate these systems in reducing WBV exposures in mining heavy equipment vehicle settings. Therefore, this laboratory-based study evaluated the efficacy of different combinations of fore-aft (x-axis), lateral (y-axis), and vertical (z-axis) suspensions in reducing WBV exposures. The results showed that the active vertical suspension more effectively reduced the vertical vibration (â?¼50%; p'sÂ <Â 0.0001) as compared to the passive vertical suspension (10%; p'sÂ <Â 0.11). The passive fore-aft (x-axis) and lateral (y-axis) suspension systems did not attenuate the corresponding axis vibration (p'sÂ >Â 0.06) and sometimes amplified the floor vibration, especially when the non-vertical vibration was predominant (p'sÂ <Â 0.02). These results indicate that there is a critical need to develop more effective engineering controls including better seat suspensions to address non-vertical WBV exposures, especially because these non-vertical WBV exposures can increase risks for adverse health effects including musculoskeletal loading, discomfort, and impaired visual acuity.","Engineering control, Lateral vibration, Musculoskeletal disorders, Mining vehicles, Seat suspension, Professional drivers, Low back pain",Jeong Ho Kim and Luz S.

"The purpose of this study was to investigate design modifications in structural firefighter turnout suits for their ability to reduce heat stress during firefighting activities. A secondary aim of this research established a benchmark for the manikin heat loss value necessary to achieve significant improvements in physiological comfort. Eight professional firefighters participated in five simulated exercise sessions wearing a control turnout suit and one of four turnout prototypes: Single Layer, Vented, Stretch, and Revolutionary. Physiological responses (internal core body temperature, skin temperature, physiological strain, heart rate, and sweat loss) were measured when wearing each turnout suit prototype. Results demonstrated a significant increase in work time and significant reductions in heat stress (core temperature, skin temperature, and physiological strain) when participants wore the Single Layer, Vented, and Revolutionary prototypes. An estimated garment heat loss value of 150â?¯W/m2 was determined in order to achieve a significant reduction in heat stress.","Firefighter, Heat stress, Physiological comfort",Meredith McQuerry and Roger Barker and Emiel DenHartog,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300656,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.03.004,0003-6870,2018,260--268,70,Applied Ergonomics,Relationship between novel design modifications and heat stress relief in structural firefightersâ?? protective clothing,article,MCQUERRY2018260
"This paper investigates the effects of shiphandling manoeuvres on mental workload and physiological reactions in ten marine pilots. Each pilot performed four berthings in a ship simulator. Those berthings were differentiated by two factors, level of difficulty and familiarity with the port. Each berthing could also be divided into five phases, three during the execution and two resting periods, one before and one after the execution (dedicated to baseline physiological data collection). Mental workload was measured through two self assessment scales: the NASA TLX and a Likert scale. Power spectral densities on Beta bands 1 and 2 were obtained from EEG. Heart rate and heart rate variability were obtained from ECG. Pupil dilation was obtained from eye tracking. Workload levels were higher as berthings increased in difficulty level and/or the pilots completed the berthings in unfamiliar ports. Responses differed across specific phases of the berthings. Physiological responses could indirectly monitor levels of mental workload, and could be adopted in future applications to evaluate training improvements and performance. This study provides an example of an applied methodology aiming to define an upper redline of task demands in the context of marine pilotage.","Mental workload, Marine pilotage, Physiological measures",Luca Orlandi and Benjamin Brooks,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300139,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.01.005,0003-6870,2018,74--92,69,Applied Ergonomics,Measuring mental workload and physiological reactions in marine pilots: Building bridges towards redlines of performance,article,ORLANDI201874

"The promising technology of stereoscopic displays is interesting to explore because 3D virtual applications are widely known. Thus, this study investigated the effect of parallax on eye fixation in stereoscopic displays. The experiment was conducted in three different levels of parallax, in which virtual balls were projected at the screen, at 20â?¯cm and 50â?¯cm in front the screen. The two important findings of this study are that parallax has significant effects on fixation duration, time to first fixation, number of fixations, and accuracy. The participant had more accurate fixations, fewer fixations, shorter fixation durations, and shorter times to first fixation when the virtual ball was projected at the screen than when it was projected at the other two levels of parallax.","Depth perception, Eye fixation, 3D tasks",Chiuhsiang Joe Lin and Retno Widyaningrum,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302867,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.12.020,0003-6870,2018,10--16,69,Applied Ergonomics,The effect of parallax on eye fixation parameter in projection-based stereoscopic displays,article,LIN201810
"Communication breakdowns in the operating room (OR) have been linked to errors during surgery. Robot-assisted surgery (RAS), a new surgical technology, can lead to new challenges in communication owing to the remote location of the surgeon away from the patient and bedside assistants. Nevertheless, few studies have studied communication strategies during RAS. In this study, 11 robot-assisted radical prostatectomies were recorded and the interaction events between the surgeon and two bedside surgical team members were categorized by modality (verbal/nonverbal), topic, and pair (sender and receiver). Both verbal and nonverbal modalities were used by all pairs. The percentage of nonverbal interactions differed significantly by pair: 66% for the Surgeon-Physician Assistant, 50% for the Physician Assistant-Scrub Nurse, and 25% for the Surgeon-Scrub Nurse, indicating different communication strategies across pairs. In addition, there was a significant dependence between topic and the percentages of verbal and nonverbal events for all pairs. Strategies to improve team communication during RAS should take into account the use of verbal and nonverbal communication means and the variation in interaction strategies based on the topic of communication.","Robot-assisted, Surgery, Teams, Communication, Teamwork, Patient safety, Nonverbal",Judith Tiferes and Ahmed A.

"The objective of this study was to assess the effect of a passive trunk exoskeleton on functional performance for various work related tasks in healthy individuals. 18 healthy men performed 12 tasks. Functional performance in each task was assessed based on objective outcome measures and subjectively in terms of perceived task difficulty, local and general discomfort. Wearing the exoskeleton tended to increase objective performance in static forward bending, but decreased performance in tasks, such as walking, carrying and ladder climbing. A significant decrease was found in perceived task difficulty and local discomfort in the back in static forward bending, but a significant increase of perceived difficulty in several other tasks, like walking, squatting and wide standing. Especially tasks that involved hip flexion were perceived more difficult with the exoskeleton. Design improvements should include provisions to allow full range of motion of hips and trunk to increase versatility and user acceptance.","Assistive device, Low back pain, User acceptance",S.J.

"Partially automated vehicles (PAVs) have been used in real-world environments for several years since the emergence of autonomous driving. It is important to understand the effects of partial automation systems (PAS) on the understanding of drivers and their behaviour during the first months of use. In order to adapt to new vehicle technology, drivers usually exhibit specific behaviours in this stage that are not intended by the developers, namely behavioural adaptation. The present study investigated the behavioural adaptations by early PAV adopters after short-term usage. A semi-structured interview was conducted among 20 â?¯Tesla drivers who had relatively high experience (one to five months) with Autopilot, and the interviews were synthesized to understand their behavioural adaptation, mental models, and trust during the period of use. The results showed that PAV drivers had a very positive attitude towards the PAS and drivers universally engaged in secondary tasks during automated driving. They also learned from their experiences to identify relatively safe usage conditions and they employed a safety margin to avoid exposure to excessively risky situations.","Automated driving, Partial automation system, Secondary task",Rui Lin and Liang Ma and Wei Zhang,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300929,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.04.006,0003-6870,2018,37--47,72,Applied Ergonomics,An interview study exploring Tesla drivers' behavioural adaptation,article,LIN201837
"Although many authors stated that a user-centred design approach in medical device development has added values, the most common research approach within healthcare is evidence-based medicine, which tend to focus on functional data rather than patient wellbeing and comfort. End user comfort is well addressed in literature for commercial products such as seats and hand tools but no data was found for medical devices. A commercial patient support device for breast radiotherapy was analysed and a relation was found between discomfort and uncompensated internal body forces. Derived from CT-images, simplified patient free-body diagrams were analysed and pain and comfort evaluated. Subsequently, a new patient position was established and prototypes were developed. Patient comfort- and prototype optimization was done through iterative prototyping. With this approach, we were able to compensate all internal body forces and establish a force neutral patient free-body diagram. This resulted in comfortable patient positioning and favourable medical results.","Comfort evaluation, Free-body diagram, Prone breast radiotherapy",Bert Boute and Liv Veldeman and Bruno Speleers and Annick {Van Greveling} and Tom {Van Hoof} and Joris {Van de Velde} and Tom Vercauteren and Wilfried {De Neve} and Jan Detand,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018301078,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.05.002,0003-6870,2018,48--57,72,Applied Ergonomics,The relation between patient discomfort and uncompensated forces of a patient support device for breast and regional lymph node radiotherapy,article,BOUTE201848
"The purpose of this study was to use radiographic measurements to compare cervical spine kinematics in various tablet computer reading postures. Radiographs were taken of twenty-two participants reading a tablet computer in five different postures. The lower cervical spine was more flexed in the semi-reclined (-8.2â?¯Â±â?¯3.8Â°) and the reclined (-14.9â?¯Â±â?¯4.0Â°) tablet positions compared to an upright (-4.43â?¯Â±â?¯4.8Â°) tablet posture.

"While many countries have dual-driver (â??two-upâ?) modes in freight rail, driver shortage creates increasing pressure to move to single-driver operations. While this change has implications for workload and safety, the roles of the primary and second drivers have not been systematically mapped. This mapping is the focus of this paper, which presents a hierarchical task analysis (HTA) from a multi-methods study (nâ?¯=â?¯40). Results indicated that transitioning from two-up to single driver operations will result in substantial changes in physical and cognitive workload for the remaining driver. These changes go much further than the simple loss of a crew-mate to double-check or verify actions and cues. This HTA can form the basis of an evidence-based safety case for the change from two-up to single-driver operations, as well as a platform for considering mechanisms to maintain safety and productivity for the now solo train driver.","Freight rail, Multi-person train crew, Hierarchical task analysis, Rail safety",Anjum Naweed and Ganesh Balakrishnan and Jillian Dorrian,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.01.002,0003-6870,2018,202--231,70,Applied Ergonomics,Going solo: Hierarchical task analysis of the second driver in â??two-upâ? (multi-person) freight rail operations,article,NAWEED2018202

"Slips, trips and falls are leading causes of fireground injuries. A functional balance test (FBT) was used to investigate the effects of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) size and design, plus firefighting work cycle. During the FBT, subjects walked along a narrow platform and turned in defined spaces, with and without an overhead obstacle. Thirty firefighters wore three varying-sized standard SCBAs and a low-profile prototype SCBA during three simulated firefighting work/rest cycles. Firefighters were tested pre- and post-firefighting activity (one bout, two bouts with a 5-min break, or back-to-back bouts with no break). Subjects committed more errors and required longer completion times with larger SCBAs. Use of the prototype SCBA lead to lower times and fewer errors. Performing a second bout of firefighting increased completion time. Firefighters need to consider how SCBA and amount of physical activity on the fireground may influence balance in order to reduce the risk of injury.","Firefighting, Self-contained breathing apparatus, Work cycle, Functional balance",Richard M.

"Objectives This study examined daily scores of fatigue and circadian rhythm markers over two-week offshore day shift periods. Methods A prospective cohort study among N = 60 offshore day-shift workers working two-week offshore shifts was conducted. Offshore day shifts lasted from 07:00 â?? 19:00 h. Fatigue was measured objectively with pre- and post-shift scores of the 3-minute psychomotor vigilance tasks (PVT-B) parameters (reaction times, number of lapses, errors and false starts) and subjectively with pre- and post-shift Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) ratings. Evening saliva samples were collected on offshore days 2,7 and 13 to measure circadian rhythm markers such as dim-light melatonin onset times and cortisol. Generalized and linear mixed model analyses were used to examine daily fatigue scores over time. Results Complete data from N = 42 offshore day shift workers was analyzed. Daily parameters of objective fatigue, PVT-B scores (reaction times, average number of lapses, errors and false starts), remained stable over the course of the two-week offshore day shifts. Daily subjective post-shift fatigue scores significantly increased over the course of the two-week offshore shifts. Each day offshore was associated with an increased post-shift subjective fatigue score of 0.06 points (95%CI: .03 - .09 p < .001). No significant statistical differences in subjective pre-shift fatigue scores were found. Neither a circadian rhythm phase shift of melatonin nor an effect on the pattern and levels of evening cortisol was found. Conclusion Daily parameters of objective fatigue scores remained stable over the course of the two-week offshore day shifts. Daily subjective post-shift fatigue scores significantly increased over the course of the two-week offshore shifts. No significant changes in circadian rhythm markers were found. Increased post-shift fatigue scores, especially during the last days of an offshore shift, should be considered and managed in (offshore) fatigue risk management programs and fatigue risk prediction models.","Cortisol, Fatigue risk management, Melatonin, Occupational health, Safety, Sleepiness",Vanessa Riethmeister and Ute BÃ¼ltmann and Marijke Gordijn and Sandra Brouwer and Michiel {de Boer},https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300942,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.04.008,0003-6870,2018,87--94,71,Applied Ergonomics,Investigating daily fatigue scores during two-week offshore day shifts,article,RIETHMEISTER201887

EVA at exposure levels corresponding to â??lifting periodsâ? of [1-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30 andâ?¯>30] kg in time intervals [0â??0.5, 0.5â??1, 1-2, 2-5, 5-10, >10] sec was computed. Back inclination was measured using tri-axial accelerometers. Compared to the other job groups, the operatorsâ?? low-back muscles were exposed to more short duration â??lifting periodsâ? with varying loads and more frequent medium duration high load â??lifting periodsâ?, respectively. The operators also worked more with their back inclined (>30Â°, >60Â°, and >90Â°) than the remaining job groups. Nonetheless, more than 41% of the workers performed heavy â??lifting periodsâ? that exceeded Danish lifting guidelines. This EVA demonstrates that almost half of the blue-collar workers were exposed to heavy low-back loading which puts them at risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders and low-back injury. Operators are, in particular, exposed to more short duration and medium duration â??lifting periodsâ? with varying load compared to warehouse-, postal- and slaughterhouse workers.","Borg, EMG, Manual handling, Occupational lifting, Physical exertion, Self-report, Low-back pain, Musculoskeletal disorders",Markus Due Jakobsen and Emil Sundstrup and Mikkel Brandt and Roger Persson and Lars L.

"Air traffic controllers are required to perform complex tasks which require attention and high precision. This study investigates how the difficulty of such tasks influences emotional states, cognitive workload and task performance. We use quantitative and qualitative measurements, including the recording of pupil dilation and changes in affect using questionnaires. Participants were required to perform a number of air traffic control tasks using the immersive human accessible Virtual Reality space in the ""eXperience Induction Machine"". Based on the data collected, we developed and validated a model which integrates personality, workload and affective theories. Our results indicate that the difficulty of an air traffic control task has a direct influence on cognitive workload as well as on the self-reported mood; whereas both mood and workload seem to change independently. In addition, we show that personality, in particular neuroticism, affects both mood and performance of the participants.","Air traffic control, Personality, Workload, Mood, Virtual reality",Martina Truschzinski and Alberto Betella and Guido Brunnett and Paul F.M.J.

"The physical environment affects how work is done in operating rooms (OR). The circulating nurse (CN), in particular, requires access to and interacts with materials, equipment, and technology more than other OR team members. Naturalistic study of CN behavior is therefore valuable in assessing how OR space and physical configuration influences work patterns and disruptions. This study evaluated the CNs' work patterns and flow disruptions (FD) by analyzing 25 surgeries across three different ORs. The OR layouts were divided into transitional and functional zones, and the work of CNs was categorized into patient, equipment, material, and information tasks. The results reveal that information tasks involve less movement than other types of work, while across all ORs, CNs were more likely to be involved in layout and environmental hazard FDs when involved in patient, material, or equipment-related tasks compared to information tasks. Different CN work patterns and flow disruptions between ORs suggest a link between OR layout and a CN's work. Future studies should examine how specific layout elements influence outcomes.","Operating room, Operating room layout, Spatial zones, Nurse tasks, Flow disruptions",David M.

"Bending down to pick things up off the floor is something that we do every day. This multisegment task can be done in a considerable number of postural configurations because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be controlled when executing it. In this study where volunteers performed a repetitive bending task, multisegment kinematic analysis allowed us to identify seven different bending strategies. Most operators used more than one bending strategy, but no particular strategy-type was found to be specific for a specific age group. However, the number of strategies used by an operator decreased with increasing age. It therefore appears that this factor influences the variability of the strategies used when repeatedly executing a movement involving the lower limbs to collect small objects from floor-level. This decrease in movement variability in senior operators may contribute to their increased risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders.","Bending strategy, Age, Work pace, Squat and stoop",Martine A.

The variability in friction and slip propensity across slip resistant (SR) shoes is poorly understood. This study aimed to quantify the impact of shoe design features on the available coefficient of friction (ACOF) across shoes labeled as SR. Differences in ACOF and the slipping rate across SR shoes were also quantified. Twelve shoes were tested across five types of flooring and three contaminant conditions using a whole shoe mechanical slip tester. Geometric and hardness parameters were measured to determine the effect of heel outsole design on ACOF. The rate of slipping was evaluated for three of the shoes on vinyl tile with canola oil using human subjects. Differences in ACOF were significant across shoe outsole designs (pâ?¯<â?¯.001). ACOF was correlated with geometrical and hardness parameters. Rate of slipping was lower for the highest ACOF shoe (pâ?¯<â?¯.001).

"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a square-profile hand rim (SPR) on propulsion technique of wheelchair tennis players. Eight experienced wheelchair tennis players performed two sets of three submaximal exercise tests and six sprint tests on a wheelchair ergometer, once with a regular rim (RR) and once with a SPR. Torque and velocity were measured continuously and power output and timing variables were calculated. No significant differences were found in propulsion technique between the RR and SPR during the submaximal tests. When sprinting with the racket, the SPR showed a significantly lower overall speed (9.1 vs. 9.8â?¯mâ?¯sâ??1), maximal speed (10.5 vs. 11.4â?¯mâ?¯sâ??1), and maximal acceleration (18.6 vs. 10.9â?¯mâ?¯sâ??2).

"We investigated the impact of a spatialized audio display on response time, workload, and accuracy while monitoring auditory information for relevance. The human ability to differentiate sound direction implies that spatial audio may be used to encode information. Therefore, it is hypothesized that spatial audio cues can be applied to aid differentiation of critical versus noncritical verbal auditory information. We used a human performance model and a laboratory study involving 24 participants to examine the effect of applying a notional, automated parser to present audio in a particular ear depending on information relevance. Operator workload and performance were assessed while subjects listened for and responded to relevant audio cues associated with critical information among additional noncritical information. Encoding relevance through spatial location in a spatial audio display system--as opposed to monophonic, binaural presentation--significantly reduced response time and workload, particularly for noncritical information. Future auditory displays employing spatial cues to indicate relevance have the potential to reduce workload and improve operator performance in similar task domains. Furthermore, these displays have the potential to reduce the dependence of workload and performance on the number of audio cues.","Spatial auditory displays, Automation, Call signs",Sungbin Kim and Michael E.

"Error management theory is drawn upon to examine how a project-based organization, which took the form of a program alliance, was able to change its established error prevention mindset to one that enacted a learning mindfulness that provided an avenue to curtail its action errors. The program alliance was required to unlearn its existing routines and beliefs to accommodate the practices required to embrace error management. As a result of establishing an error management culture the program alliance was able to create a collective mindfulness that nurtured learning and supported innovation. The findings provide a much-needed context to demonstrate the relevance of error management theory to effectively address rework and safety problems in construction projects. The robust theoretical underpinning that is grounded in practice and presented in this paper provides a mechanism to engender learning from errors, which can be utilized by construction organizations to improve the productivity and performance of their projects.","Action errors, Construction, Error management, Learning, Rework, Safety incidents, Unlearning",Peter E.D.

"Purpose-designed compliant flooring and carpeting have been promoted as a means for reducing fall-related injuries in high-risk environments, such as long-term care. However, it is not known whether these surfaces influence the forces that long-term care staff exert when pushing residents in wheelchairs.

During straight-line pushing, carpet overlay increased initial and sustained hand forces compared to vinyl overlay by 22â??49% over a concrete subfloor and by 8â??20% over a compliant subfloor. Compliant subflooring increased initial and sustained hand forces compared to concrete subflooring by 18â??31% when under a vinyl overlay.

"This article includes two studies investigating the impact of anecdotal healthcare information from the Internet on healthcare decisions. The availability of anecdotal information on the Internet through social media and peer support groups has increased the risk of the dissemination of misleading information. The first study investigated the effect of demographics, quality of life, health status and public reports usage on the use of anecdotal healthcare information from the Internet. The second employed a 2 (anecdotal information presented as videos supporting and contradicting public report information) * 2 (phase of introduction of anecdotal information: early, late) between-subjects experimental design to investigate the consumer's choice between two health facilities, the level of confidence in the decision, the knowledge acquired and the workload experienced. The results from the first study found that age, gender, educational level, health status and public report usage were significant predictors of consumer use of anecdotal information on the Internet. The results from the second suggest that the probability of making the optimal choice was reduced by more than half when contradicting rather than supporting anecdotal information was presented first. The data from anecdotal information became the anchor points for developing an understanding of the healthcare situation, meaning initial perceptions did not change after the presentation of the more reliable public reports. Because of comprehension issues related to public reports, consumers may give more weight to anecdotal information found online. Thus, new approaches are needed to ensure the former is engaging for a wide range of healthcare consumers.","Healthcare consumer decision making, Anecdotal information, Public reports",Kapil {Chalil Madathil} and Joel S.

"Augmented reality has the potential to improve the effectiveness of collision warnings in vehicles because they inherently convey spatial information about the hazard and can guide the attention of the driver towards it. For future warning systems, which can detect sight obstructed dangers, related work already revealed some advantages. In a driving simulator study with 80 participants, we investigated the effects of three corresponding design parameters which are commonly integrated at augmented reality warnings. This study analyzes the individual contribution of specific warning symbols, warning animation, and spatial referencing. Part one of the study concentrates on the effectiveness of necessary warnings and part two on the driversâ?? compliance despite false alarms. Compared to the control condition with static unspecific warning symbols, static specific warning symbols depicting the type and motion direction of the hazard led to several but inconsistent advantages. The scaling animation only improved subjective evaluation. However, spatial referencing of an (unspecific) warning symbol consistently improved driversâ?? reactions to as well as evaluations of necessary and unnecessary warnings. The results emphasize the potential of spatial referencing, particularly for in-vehicle warnings of future collision avoidance systems.","Collision avoidance, Sight obstruction, Reliability, Warning design, Specific warnings, Augmented reality, Spatial referencing, Specificity",Felix Schwarz and Wolfgang Fastenmeier,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018301005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.05.001,0003-6870,2018,25--36,72,Applied Ergonomics,Visual advisory warnings about hidden dangers: Effects of specific symbols and spatial referencing on necessary and unnecessary warnings,article,SCHWARZ201825
"Steering systems of trucks consist of many linkages, which introduce nonlinearities that may negatively affect steering performance. Nowadays, it is possible to equip steering systems with actuators that provide artificial steering characteristics. However, before new steering systems are deployed in real vehicles, evaluation in a safe and controlled simulator environment is recommended. A much-debated question is whether experiments need to be performed in a motion-base simulator or whether a fixed-base simulator suffices. Furthermore, it is unknown whether simulator-based tests can be validly conducted with a convenience sample of university participants who have not driven a truck before. We investigated the effect of steering characteristic (i.e., nonlinear vs. linear) on drivers' subjective opinions about the ride and the steering system, and on their objective driving performance in an articulated tractor-semitrailer combination. Thirty-two participants (12 truck drivers and 20 university drivers) each completed eight 5.5-min drives in which the simulator's motion system was either turned on or off and the steering model either resembled a linear (i.e., artificial) or nonlinear (i.e., realistic) system. Per drive, participants performed a lane-keeping task, merged onto the highway, and completed four overtaking manoeuvers. Results showed that the linear steering system yielded less subjective and objective steering effort, and better lane-keeping performance, than the nonlinear system. Consistent with prior research, participants drove a wider path through curves when motion was on compared to when motion was off. Truck drivers exhibited higher steering activity than university drivers, but there were no significant differences between the two groups in lane keeping performance and steering effort. We conclude that for future truck steering systems, a linear system may be valuable for improving performance. Furthermore, the results suggest that on-centre evaluations of steering systems do not require a motion base, and should not be performed using a convenience sample of university students.",,Barys Shyrokau and Joost {De Winter} and Olaf Stroosma and Chris Dijksterhuis and Jan Loof and Rene {van Paassen} and Riender Happee,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300796,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.03.018,0003-6870,2018,17--28,71,Applied Ergonomics,"The effect of steering-system linearity, simulator motion, and truck driving experience on steering of an articulated tractor-semitrailer combination",article,SHYROKAU201817
"This is a world's first-of-a-kind study providing empirical evidence for understanding submarine control room performance when completing higher and lower demand Dived Tracking (DT) scenarios. A submarine control room simulator was built, using a non-commercial version of Dangerous Waters as the simulation engine. The creation of networked workstations allowed a team of nine operators to perform tasks completed by submarine command teams during DT. The Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST) method was used to model the social, task and information networks and describe command team performance. Ten teams were recruited for the study, affording statistical comparisons of how command team roles and level of demand affected performance. Results indicate that command teams can covertly DT a contact differently depending on demand (e.g. volume of contacts). In low demand it was possible to use periscope more often than in high demand, in a â??duck-and-runâ?? fashion. Therefore, the type of information and frequency of particular task completion, was significantly different between the higher and lower demand conditions. This resulted in different operators in the command team experiencing greater demand depending on how the DT mission objective was completed. Potential bottlenecks in the command team were identified and implications are discussed alongside suggestions for future work.","Submarine, Team work, Command and control, Networks",Aaron P.J.

"Exoskeletons are progressively reaching homes and workplaces, allowing interaction with virtual environments, remote control of robots, or assisting human operators in carrying heavy loads. Their design is however still a challenge as these robots, being mechanically linked to the operators who wear them, have to meet ergonomic constraints besides usual robotic requirements in terms of workspace, speed, or efforts. They have in particular to fit the anthropometry and mobility of their users. This traditionally results in numerous prototypes which are progressively fitted to each individual person. In this paper, we propose instead to validate the design of a hand exoskeleton in a fully digital environment, without the need for a physical prototype. The purpose of this study is thus to examine whether finger kinematics are altered when using a given hand exoskeleton. Therefore, user specific musculoskeletal models were created and driven by a motion capture system to evaluate the fingers' joint kinematics when performing two industrial related tasks. The kinematic chain of the exoskeleton was added to the musculoskeletal models and its compliance with the hand movements was evaluated. Our results show that the proposed exoskeleton design does not influence fingersâ?? joints angles, the coefficient of determination between the model with and without exoskeleton being consistently high (R2Â¯=0.93) and the nRMSE consistently low (nRMSEÂ¯ = 5.42Â°). These results are promising and this approach combining musculoskeletal and robotic modeling driven by motion capture data could be a key factor in the ergonomics validation of the design of orthotic devices and exoskeletons prior to manufacturing.","Exoskeleton, Biomechanics, Hand, Musculoskeletal modeling, Design validation, Industrial task",Clint Hansen and Florian Gosselin and Khalil {Ben Mansour} and Pierre Devos and Frederic Marin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302648,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.11.015,0003-6870,2018,283--288,68,Applied Ergonomics,Design-validation of a hand exoskeleton using musculoskeletal modeling,article,HANSEN2018283
"In this study, foldable bicycles were evaluated in terms of their usability. Four types of folding mechanisms were identified depending on the number of pivots and the pivot axis direction: single lateral pivot (SLP), single vertical pivot, dual lateral pivot, and combined verticalâ??lateral pivot. Next, four bicyclesâ??one each of these four typesâ??were selected as test specimens. Ten subjects performed folding and unfolding tasks on each of these bicycles, and three-dimensional body motions and ground reaction forces were measured. The maximum trunk flexion angles and maximum increments in the ground reaction force were used as governing parameters for evaluating the comfort level for each bicycle type. The SLP type provided the lowest upper body flexion and ground reaction force and was hence judged to be the most comfortable folding system. Hence, a promising type of easily foldable bicycle was proposed, thereby encouraging its incorporation into public transit systems.","Foldable bicycle, Pivot axis, Motion analysis",Jongryun Roh and Joonho Hyeong and Sayup Kim,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.01.003,0003-6870,2018,58--65,69,Applied Ergonomics,Influence of folding mechanism of bicycles on their usability,article,ROH201858
"Slips, trips, and falls (STF) of firefighters may occur while traversing stationary obstacles. STF risk may be amplified by fatigue from firefighting and carrying an asymmetric load. Vertical and horizontal clearances of the lead (VCL, HCL) and trailing (VCT, HCT) foot and contact with a 30â?¯cm obstacle were examined in 24 firefighters. We examined the impact on obstacle crossing performance due to three exercise protocols (treadmill walking or simulated firefighting in an environmental chamber, and simulated firefighting in a live-fire burn building) and carrying a hose load on the right shoulder. Post-activity fatigue resulted in significant decreases in HCL and VCT. Adding a hose load did not affect choice of lead/trailing foot, but did significantly decreased HCL and increased VCL. The hose load amplified acute fatigue effects by causing a sharper decrease in both VCL and VCT. Clearances were significantly impacted by interaction effects of exercise protocol type and acute fatigue. HCL decreased and VCL remained consistent following both simulated firefighting tasks, but HCL remained unchanged and VCL increased following the treadmill protocol. Contact errors increased with fatigue and load, and more errors occurred following simulated firefighting task protocols compared to treadmill walking. Our findings suggest that both acute fatigue and carrying an additional load can cause decrements in firefighter movement, which may place a firefighter at greater STF risk. Simulated firefighting testing protocols may have greater impact on movement performance than treadmill walking. Knowledge of these results may assist in the development of a reliable, laboratory based, and standardizable simulated firefighting exercise protocol.","Foot clearance, Obstacle crossing, Firefighters",Michael J.

"Bomb attacks on civil aviation make detecting improvised explosive devices and explosive material in passenger baggage a major concern. In the last few years, explosive detection systems for cabin baggage screening (EDSCB) have become available. Although used by a number of airports, most countries have not yet implemented these systems on a wide scale. We investigated the benefits of EDSCB with two different levels of automation currently being discussed by regulators and airport operators: automation as a diagnostic aid with an on-screen alarm resolution by the airport security officer (screener) or EDSCB with an automated decision by the machine. The two experiments reported here tested and compared both scenarios and a condition without automation as baseline. Participants were screeners at two international airports who differed in both years of work experience and familiarity with automation aids. Results showed that experienced screeners were good at detecting improvised explosive devices even without EDSCB. EDSCB increased only their detection of bare explosives. In contrast, screeners with less experience (tenureâ?¯<â?¯1 year) benefitted substantially from EDSCB in detecting both improvised explosive devices and bare explosives. A comparison of all three conditions showed that automated decision provided better humanâ??machine detection performance than on-screen alarm resolution and no automation. This came at the cost of slightly higher false alarm rates on the humanâ??machine system level, which would still be acceptable from an operational point of view. Results indicate that a wide-scale implementation of EDSCB would increase the detection of explosives in passenger bags and automated decision instead of automation as diagnostic aid with on screen alarm resolution should be considered.","Airport security X-ray screening, Explosives detection, Automation",Nicole HÃ¤ttenschwiler and Yanik Sterchi and Marcia Mendes and Adrian Schwaninger,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701830108X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.05.003,0003-6870,2018,58--68,72,Applied Ergonomics,Automation in airport security X-ray screening of cabin baggage: Examining benefits and possible implementations of automated explosives detection,article,HATTENSCHWILER201858
"Reading at a glance, once a relatively infrequent mode of reading, is becoming common. Mobile interaction paradigms increasingly dominate the way in which users obtain information about the world, which often requires reading at a glance, whether from a smartphone, wearable device, or in-vehicle interface. Recent research in these areas has shown that a number of factors can affect text legibility when words are briefly presented in isolation. Here we expand upon this work by examining how legibility is affected by more crowded presentations. Word arrays were combined with a lexical decision task, in which the size of the text elements and the inter-line spacing (leading) between individual items were manipulated to gauge their relative impacts on text legibility. In addition, a single-word presentation condition that randomized the location of presentation was compared with previous work that held position constant. Results show that larger text was more legible than smaller text. Wider leading significantly enhanced legibility as well, but contrary to expectations, wider leading did not fully counteract decrements in legibility at smaller text sizes. Single-word stimuli presented with random positioning were more difficult to read than stationary counterparts from earlier studies. Finally, crowded displays required much greater processing time compared to single-word displays. These results have implications for modern interface design, which often present interactions in the form of scrollable and/or selectable lists. The present findings are of practical interest to the wide community of graphic designers and interface engineers responsible for developing our interfaces of daily use.","Typography, Legibility, Visual crowding",Jonathan Dobres and Benjamin Wolfe and Nadine Chahine and Bryan Reimer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300681,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.03.007,0003-6870,2018,240--246,70,Applied Ergonomics,"The effects of visual crowding, text size, and positional uncertainty on text legibility at a glance",article,DOBRES2018240
"Display clutter can have differential effects based on environmental factors, such as workload, stress, and experiment paradigm. The objectives of the current study were to assess the effects of display clutter on driver performance and attention allocation and compare results across two experimental paradigms. Forty-two participants searched high- and low-clutter in-car navigation displays for routine information either during a static, presentation-based experiment or in a dynamic, driving simulator experiment. Results revealed display clutter to significantly alter attention allocation and degrade performance in the presentation experiment, but had little to no effect on driver performance or attention allocation in the driving simulator experiment. Results suggest that display clutter may have its greatest effect on performance and attention allocation in domains requiring extended attention to the cluttered display compared to tasks in which the cluttered display acts as a support tool for secondary tasks.","Display clutter, Driving simulator, Driver performance, Attention allocation",Carl Pankok and David Kaber,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300164,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.01.008,0003-6870,2018,136--145,69,Applied Ergonomics,The effect of navigation display clutter on performance and attention allocation in presentation- and simulator-based driving experiments,article,PANKOK2018136

In Part III, subjects completed, in random-order on separate days, 4.83â?¯km Pack Tests in L-EX or L-W conditions. In Part I, peak oxygen uptake was reduced (pâ?¯<â?¯.05) in L-W. In Part II, mass-specific oxygen uptake was significantly higher in both work clothing conditions. In Part III, Pack Test time was slower (pâ?¯<â?¯.05) in L-W.

"This paper describes the process and tools developed as part of a multidisciplinary collaborative simulation-based approach for iterative design and evaluation of operating room (OR) prototypes. Full-scale physical mock-ups of healthcare spaces offer an opportunity to actively communicate with and to engage multidisciplinary stakeholders in the design process. While mock-ups are increasingly being used in healthcare facility design projects, they are rarely evaluated in a manner to support active user feedback and engagement. Researchers and architecture students worked closely with clinicians and architects to develop OR design prototypes and engaged clinical end-users in simulated scenarios. An evaluation toolkit was developed to compare design prototypes. The mock-up evaluation helped the team make key decisions about room size, location of OR table, intra-room zoning, and doors location. Structured simulation based mock-up evaluations conducted in the design process can help stakeholders visualize their future workspace and provide active feedback.","Operating room, Mock-up, Mock-up evaluation, Multidisciplinary design evaluation, Design communication, Simulation",Sara Bayramzadeh and Anjali Joseph and David Allison and Jonas Shultz and James Abernathy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300723,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.03.011,0003-6870,2018,288--299,70,Applied Ergonomics,Using an integrative mock-up simulation approach for evidence-based evaluation of operating room design prototypes,article,BAYRAMZADEH2018288
"Process control environments are characterised by rapid changes in work demands, the successful response to which is dependent upon the availability of cognitive resources. Since high cue utilisation is associated with a reduction in cognitive load and a consequent release of residual resources, it was hypothesised that participants with high cue utilisation would experience lower subjective arousal and lower physiological effort in response to increases in the work demands associated with a simulated rail control task. A total of 41 participants completed a 10â?¯min, low work demand period, followed by a 10â?¯min, high work demand condition. High cue utilisation was associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure and the maintenance of sustained, superior performance in response to high work demands. However, an increase in subjective arousal was also evident. The outcomes have implications for the selection and assessment of operators of high reliability, dynamic, process control environments.","Cue utilisation, Effort, Arousal, Physiology, Process-control",Mark W.

"Information on spinal loading for using lift assist systems for airport baggage handling is lacking. We conducted a laboratory study to evaluate a vacuum lift system for reducing lumbar spinal loads during baggage loading/unloading tasks. Ten subjects performed the tasks using the industry average baggage weight of 14.5â?¯kg on a typical two-shelved baggage cart with or without using the lift system (i.e. lifting technique). Repeated measures analysis of variance (2 tasks Ã? 2 shelf heights x 2 techniques) was used. Spinal loads were estimated by an electromyography-driven biomechanical model. On average, the vacuum lift system reduced spinal compressive forces on the lumbar spine by 39% and below the 3400â?¯N damage threshold. The system also resulted in a 25% reduction in the anterior-posterior shear force at the L5/S1 inferior endplate level. This study provides evidence for the potential to reduce spinal loads when using a vacuum lift system.","Airport baggage lifting, Biomechanical model, Vacuum lift",Ming-Lun Lu and Jonathan S.

"Floor mats are commonplace in commercial buildings, particularly in entry ways. These mats are routinely handled by delivery personnel as the mats are picked up for cleaning and clean mats are deployed. A new two-part mat design, which eliminates the need to move the rubber base during mat change operations, was hypothesized to reduce the physical demands on delivery personnel. Electromyographic data from back and shoulder muscles and spinal kinematics were obtained as 12 volunteers simulated mat selection, mat deployment, and mat pick-up tasks. Other factors considered in this study included mat size, pick-up method, and mat textile orientation during deployment. Results indicated that the two-part design reduced muscle activation levels across all tasks. Biomechanical benefits were also found when the mats were picked-up using a kick-fold as opposed to hand-fold method and when mats were deployed with the textile component rolled towards the inside of the roll.","Musculoskeletal disorders, Low back, Shoulder, Delivery driver, Floor mat",Xueke Wang and Steven Bigelow and Kelly E.

"The aim of this study was to quantify laparoscopic instrument use and actions of both limbs during a sample of common colorectal surgical procedures. A method was devised using Observer XT software to code video recordings. Anonymised HD video recordings of nine laparoscopic colorectal procedures performed by a single surgeon were analysed. We determined the percentage and frequency of instrument use and limb actions throughout the total laparoscopic surgical duration, as well as the duration of instrument inactivity. Seven instruments and seven actions were studied across nine surgical procedures. Manoeuvring, blunt dissection, and tenting up tissues accounted for the longest amount of total surgical time (non-dominant hand (NDH) 29%, dominant hand (DH) 39%), followed by grasping (NDH 33%, DH 9%), and cauterising (NDH <0.2%, DH 8%). Least time was spent performing other actions such as suction/irrigation (NDH 0.01%, DH 3%) and stapling colorectal tissue (NDH 0.03%, DH 0.5%). The total duration of instrument use and hand actions by the dominant and non-dominant hands were similar overall. However, the frequency of actions performed was lower for the non-dominant hand. This indicates that the non-dominant hand spent more time holding actions than switching between actions, supporting the actions of the dominant hand. These findings highlight the lengthy durations of laparoscopic surgical procedures involved in navigating to anatomical planes and moving tissues. Further, the results detail the extent of secondary functions performed with the surgical instruments.","Laparoscopic, Instrument hand actions, Video analysis",Eoin J.

"As modern society becomes more reliant on technology, its use within the vehicle is becoming a concern for road safety due to both portable and built-in devices offering sources of distraction. While the effects of distracting technologies are well documented, little is known about the causal factors that lead to the drivers' engagement with technological devices. The relevance of the sociotechnical system within which the behaviour occurs requires further research. This paper presents two experiments, the first aims to assess the drivers self-reported decision to engage with technological tasks while driving and their reasoning for doing so with respect to the wider sociotechnical system. This utilised a semi-structured interview method, conducted with 30 drivers to initiate a discussion on their likelihood of engaging with 22 different tasks across 7 different road types. Inductive thematic analysis provided a hierarchical thematic framework that detailed the self-reported causal factors that influence the driversâ?? use of technology whilst driving. The second experiment assessed the relevance of the hierarchical framework to a model of distraction that was established from within the literature on the drivers use of distracting technologies while driving. The findings provide validation for some relationships studied in the literature, as well as providing insights into relationships that require further study. The role of the sociotechnical system in the engagement of distractions while driving is highlighted, with the causal factors reported by drivers suggesting the importance of considering the wider system within which the behaviour is occurring and how it may be creating the conditions for distraction to occur. This supports previous claims made within the literature based model. Recommendations are proposed that encourage a movement away from individual focused countermeasures towards systemic actors.","In-vehicle technology, Driver distraction, Qualitative methods, Sociotechnical systems",Katie J.

"Background Head-up and wearable displays, such as Google Glassâ?¢, are sometimes marketed as safe in-vehicle alternatives to phone-based displays, as they allow drivers to receive messages without eye-off-the-road glances. However, head-up displays can still compromise driver performance (e.g., He et al., 2015b), as the distracting effect of interacting with any device will depend on the user's multitasking strategies. The present experiment examined drivers' interaction with a head-down smartphone display and a wearable head-up display. Method Participants performed a simulated driving task while receiving and responding to text messages via smartphone or the head-mounted display (HMD) on the Google Glassâ?¢. Incoming messages were signaled by an auditory alert, and responses were made vocally. Results When using Google Glass, participants' responses were quicker than that of smartphone, and the time to engage in a task did not vary according to lane-keeping difficulty. Results suggest that a willingness to engage more readily in distracting tasks may offset the potential safety benefits of wearable devices.","Texting while driving, Driver distraction, Multitasking strategy, Wearable devices, Head-mounted display, Google Glass",Jibo He and Jason S.

"Hand dexterity is an important index to assess whether extravehicular activity (EVA) gloves are appropriately designed. Pressurized gloves and low temperature environments can both cause a decrease in hand dexterity. However, due to the difficulty in performing tests under extreme conditions, there has been no report on dexterity tests with gloves under pressure and low temperature. To fill this gap, we performed a dexterity test of EVA gloves with twelve male volunteers involved under the extreme conditions, which were created in the low-pressure simulation cabin with vaporized liquid nitrogen used to cool it down. A total of nine conditions were designed. Purdue pegboard test and nut fastening test were improved before being applied in a hand dexterity test. Completion times for both tests, finger temperatures and cold feeling of the hand were recorded and analyzed. Results showed that the completion times for both tests increased either as the temperature decreased or as the pressure increased. Furthermore, a combined effect of low temperature and pressure was observed. The study provides evidence in support of astronaut training and optimization of EVA glove productivity.","EVA glove, Dexterity, Low temperature, Pressure, Finger temperature",Yinsheng Tian and Haibo Zhang and Li Wang and Li Ding and Deyu Li,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018300322,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.02.008,0003-6870,2018,98--103,70,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of EVA glove on hand dexterity at low temperature and low pressure,article,TIAN201898
"Learning flight procedures is part of any pilot training. The conventional learning method consists in learning and practicing the procedure written on a sheet of paper along with printed images of the cockpit. The purpose of the present paper was to test the efficiency of a tactile interactive multimedia training tool designed to foster the self-regulated learning of flight procedures, especially through enacting relevant gestures and providing feedback. Results showed that learning with this tool did not lead to significant shorter learning times than with the conventional learning. However, on a delayed retention test in a real A320 cockpit simulator, learners of the experimental group performed the procedure more rapidly than those of the control group. Results suggested that a training tool that incites learners to perform similar gestures than those in the real environment and that provides feedback, helped learners to transform declarative into procedural knowledge.","Procedural learning, Multimedia learning, Embodied cognition",Nadine Matton and Camille Vrignaud and Yves Rouillard and Julie LemariÃ©,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701830070X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.03.009,0003-6870,2018,253--259,70,Applied Ergonomics,Learning flight procedures by enacting and receiving feedback,article,MATTON2018253
"This study examined color-concept associations among designers and non-designers with commonly used warning and operation concepts. This study required 199 designers and 175 non-designers to indicate their choice among nine colors to associate with each of the 38 concepts in a color-concept table. The results showed that the designers and non-designers had the same color associations and similar strengths of stereotypes for 17 concepts. The strongest color-concept stereotypes for both groups were red-danger, red-fire, and red-hot. However, the designers and non-designers had different color associations for the concepts of escape (green, red), increase (green, red), potential hazard (red, orange), fatal (black, red), and normal (white, green), while the strengths of the 16 remaining associations for both groups were not at equivalent levels. These findings provide ergonomists and design practitioners with a better understanding of population stereotypes for color coding, and consequently to effectively use colors in their user-centered designs.","Stereotype, Color-concept association, Design",Annie W.Y.

"Previous research suggests that operators with high workload can distrust and then poorly monitor automation, which has been generally inferred from automation dependence behaviors. To test automation monitoring more directly, the current study measured operators' visual attention allocation, workload, and trust toward imperfect automation in a dynamic multitasking environment. Participants concurrently performed a manual tracking task with two levels of difficulty and a system monitoring task assisted by an unreliable signaling system. Eye movement data indicate that operators allocate less visual attention to monitor automation when the tracking task is more difficult. Participants reported reduced levels of trust toward the signaling system when the tracking task demanded more focused visual attention. Analyses revealed that trust mediated the relationship between the load of the tracking task and attention allocation in Experiment 1, an effect that was not replicated in Experiment 2. Results imply a complex process underlying task load, visual attention allocation, and automation trust during multitasking. Automation designers should consider operatorsâ?? task load in multitasking workspaces to avoid reduced automation monitoring and distrust toward imperfect signaling systems.","Human-machine systems, Trust, Attention allocation, Human-automation interaction",Nicole D.

"This article reviews studies conducted â??in the wildâ? that explore the â??ironies of automationâ? in Robotic Assisted Surgery (RAS). Workload may be reduced for the surgeon, but increased for other team members, with postural stress relocated rather than reduced, and the introduction of a range of new challenges, for example, in the need to control multiple arms, with multiple instruments; and the increased demands of being physically separated from the team. Workflow disruptions were not compared with other surgeries; however, the prevalence of equipment and training disruptions differs from other types of surgeries. A consistent observation is that communication and coordination problems are relatively frequent, suggesting that the surgical team may need to be trained to use specific verbal and non-verbal cues during surgery. RAS also changes the necessary size of the operating room instrument cleaning processes. These studies demonstrate the value of clinically-based human factors engineers working alongside surgical teams to improve the delivery of RAS.","Surgery, Robotics, Human factors, Automation, Workload, Teamwork",Ken Catchpole and Ann Bisantz and M.

"The Swedish health care system is reorienting towards horizontal organization for care processes. A main challenge is to engage health care clinicians in the process. The aim of this study was to assess engagement (i.e. attitudes and beliefs, the cognitive state and clinical engagement behaviour) among health care clinicians, and to investigate how engagement was related to work resources and demands during organizational redesign. A cohort study was conducted, using a questionnaire distributed to clinicians at five hospitals working with care process improvement approaches, two of them having implemented Lean production. The results show that kinds of engagement are interlinked and contribute to clinical engagement behaviour in quality of care and patient safety. Increased work resources have importance for engagements in organizational improvements, especially in top-down implementations.

"Lack of physical activity is a severe health concern in the United States with fewer than half of all Americans meeting the recommended weekly physical activity guidelines. Although wearable fitness devices can be effective in motivating people to be active, consumers are abandoning this technology soon after purchase.

Novice users completed a brief interaction with a fitness device similar to a first purchase experience before completing questionnaires about their interaction. We found computer self-efficacy, physical activity level, as well as personality traits indirectly increased the desire to use a fitness device and influenced the saliency of perceived motivational affordances.

"Multiple sensing mechanisms could be used in forming responses to avoid slips, but previous studies, correlating only two parameters, revealed a limited picture of this complex system. In this study, the participants walked as fast as possible without a slip under 15 conditions of different degrees of slipperiness. The relationships among various response parameters, including perceived slipperiness rating, utilized coefficient of friction (UCOF), slipmeter measurement and kinematic parameters, were evaluated. The results showed that the UCOF, perceived rating and heel angle had higher adjusted R2 values as dependent variables in the multiple linear regressions with the remaining variables in the final pool as independent variables. Although each variable in the final data pool could reflect some measurement of slipperiness, these three variables are more inclusive than others in representing the other variables and were bigger predictors of other variables, so they could be better candidates for measurements of slipperiness.","Measurement of slipperiness, Perception rating of slipperiness, Coefficient of friction, Human locomotion, Friction utilization",Wen-Ruey Chang and Chien-Chi Chang,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302545,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.11.005,0003-6870,2018,117--124,68,Applied Ergonomics,Relationship among several measurements of slipperiness obtained in a laboratory environment,article,CHANG2018117
"Individual finger force (FF) in a grip task is a vital concern in rehabilitation engineering and precise control of manipulators because disorders in any of the fingers will affect the stability or accuracy of the grip force (GF). To understand the functions of each finger in a dynamic grip exertion task, a GF following experiment with four individual fingers without thumb was designed. This study obtained four individual FFs from the distal phalanges with a cylindrical handle in dynamic GF following tasks. Ten healthy male subjects with similar hand sizes participated in the four-finger linear GF following tasks at different submaximal voluntary contraction (SMVC) levels. The total GF, individual FF, finger force contribution, and following error were subsequently calculated and analyzed. The statistics indicated the following: 1) the accuracy and stability of GF at low %MVC were significantly higher than those at high SMVC; 2) at low SMVC, the ability of the fingers to increase the GF was better than the ability to reduce it, but it was contrary at high SMVC; 3) when the target wave (TW) was changing, all four fingers strongly participated in the force exertion, but the participation of the little finger decreased significantly when TW remained stable; 4) the index finger and ring finger had a complementary relationship and played a vital role in the adjustment and control of GF. The middle finger and little finger had a minor influence on the force control and adjustment. In conclusion, each of the fingers had different functions in a GF following task.

"The aim of this study was to assess the elongation of the skin surface of the spine for simulated industrial lifting and lowering tasks to aid the design of industrial exoskeletons worn on the back. Eighteen male participants lifted and lowered a box of varying loads (5â?¯kg, 10â?¯kg, 15â?¯kg) using three techniques (squat, semi-squat, stooped) from the ground to a table. Motion capture sensors attached to the spine from C7 to S1 measured movement.

"A unique feature of battery electric vehicles (BEV) is their regenerative braking system (RBS) to recapture kinetic energy in deceleration maneuvers. If such a system is triggered via gas pedal, most deceleration maneuvers can be executed by just using this pedal. This impacts the driving task as different deceleration strategies can be applied. Previous research has indicated that a RBS failure leading to a sudden reduced deceleration represents an adverse event for BEV drivers. In the present study, we investigated such a failure's impact on the driver's evaluation and behavior. We conducted an experiment on a closed-off test track using a modified BEV that could temporarily switch off the RBS. One half of the 44 participants in the study received information about an upcoming RBS failure whereas the other half did not. While 91% of the drivers receiving prior information noticed the RBS failure, only 48% recognized it in the â??uniformedâ? group. In general, the failure and the perception of its occurrence influenced the driver's evaluation and behavior more than receiving prior information. Nevertheless, under the tested conditions, drivers kept control and were able to compensate for the RBS failure. As the participants drove quite simple maneuvers in our experiment, further studies are needed to validate our findings using more complex driving settings. Given that RBS failures could have severe consequences, appropriate information and warning strategies for drivers are necessary.","Battery electric vehicles, Regenerative braking, Controllability, Failures, Traffic safety",Peter Cocron and Isabel Neumann and Maria KreuÃ?lein and Daniel Wanner and Maxim Bierbach and Josef F.

"This cross-sectional study investigated musculoskeletal discomfort and computer use in university staff, through the use of online questionnaires. Results showed a high prevalence of staff reported musculoskeletal discomfort during the preceding year (80%), with neck (60%), shoulder (53%) and lower back discomfort (47%) being the most common. Most believed discomfort was caused by work, although neck discomfort was significantly less in those reporting excellent mental health (OR 0.44, pâ?¯<â?¯0.01). Computer navigation was performed primarily by mouse (77%); however, using a touch pad increased the odds (OR 1.17, pâ?¯<â?¯0.01) of wrist discomfort and the belief it was caused by work (OR 1.19, pâ?¯<â?¯0.01).

"A head-mounted display (HMD) with inappropriate mass and center of mass (COM) increases the physical workload of HMD users. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mass and COM of HMD on physical workload. Twelve subjects participated in this study. The mass and posteroanterior COM position were 0.8, 1.2, or 1.6Â kg and â??7.0, 0.0, or 7.0Â cm, respectively. The subjects gazed at the target objects in four test postures: the neutral, look-up, body-bending, and look-down postures. The normalized joint torques for the neck and the lumbar region were calculated based on the measured segment angles. The results showed that the neck joint torque was significantly affected by mass and COM and it increased as the HMD mass increased for all test postures. The COM position that minimized the neck joint torque varied depending on the test postures, and the recommended ranges of COM were identified.","Head-mounted display, Biomechanical analysis, Physical workload",Takanori Chihara and Akihiko Seo,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701730265X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.11.016,0003-6870,2018,204--212,68,Applied Ergonomics,Evaluation of physical workload affected by mass and center of mass of head-mounted display,article,CHIHARA2018204
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a passive upper body exoskeleton on muscle activity, perceived musculoskeletal effort, local perceived pressure and subjective usability for a static overhead task. Eight participants (4 male, 4 female) held a load (0â?¯kg and 2â?¯kg) three times overhead for a duration of 30â?¯s each, both with and without the exoskeleton. Muscle activity was significantly reduced for the Biceps Brachii (49%) and Medial Deltoid (62%) by the device for the 2â?¯kg load. Perceived effort of the arms was significantly lower with the device for the 2â?¯kg load (41%). The device did not have a significant effect on trunk or leg muscle activity (for the 2â?¯kg load) or perceived effort. Local perceived pressure was rated below 2 (low pressure levels) for all contact areas assessed. Half of the participants rated the device usability as acceptable. The exoskeleton reduced muscle activity and perceived effort by the arms, and had no significant negative effect on the trunk and lower body with regards to muscle activity, perceived effort and localised discomfort.",,Kirsten Huysamen and Tim Bosch and Michiel {de Looze} and Konrad S.

"Situation awareness (SA) is an important component of an individual's ability to function in a complex environment. As such, it is essential to have effective measures of an individual's SA. The most widely used subjective measure of SA is the Situation Awareness Rating Technique [SART]. However, SART has been criticised for not predicting performance or objective SA, and being highly correlated with workload. This paper describes the development and testing of a new subjective measure of SA, the Low-Event Task Subjective Situation Awareness (LETSSA) measure. To evaluate LETSSA a train simulator study was conducted with 23 novice and 26 expert freight train drivers. LETSSA was able to detect differences in manipulated SA and was comparable to an established objective SA measure (SAGAT). LETSSA was significantly associated with performance but not significantly associated with workload. While further validation is required, LETSSA shows promise as an effective subjective measure of SA.","Situation awareness, SAGAT, SART, Real-world measurement of situation awareness, Naturalistic settings",Janette Rose and Chris Bearman and Jillian Dorrian,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302703,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.12.006,0003-6870,2018,273--282,68,Applied Ergonomics,The Low-Event Task Subjective Situation Awareness (LETSSA) technique: Development and evaluation of a new subjective measure of situation awareness,article,ROSE2018273
"The numerous opportunities for effect modifications pose a major challenge in ergonomic intervention research. Even studies in systematic reviews that are assessed as being of high quality generally lack any proper consideration of the potential effect modifiers. We have developed a method for effect modifier assessment (EMA) in intervention research. The EMA method uses a participatory workshop consisting of representatives from all occupational groups in the investigated organization. The workshop identifies both intervention and modifier events including â??confoundersâ? and â??effect modifiersâ? according to epidemiologic terminology. These are categorized into themes, then analyzed and evaluated for their potential effects on the investigated outcomes. The overall impact of the pooled modifier themes is finally estimated in relation to the estimated impact of the intervention events. In the present study, the EMA method was tested in two cases. The findings suggest that it provides information that strengthens inferences about the impact of the investigated ergonomic interventions. Further evaluation of the method is recommended.","Ergonomic intervention, Effect modification, Research method",Kasper Edwards and JÃ¶rgen Winkel,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018301303,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2018.05.007,0003-6870,2018,113--120,72,Applied Ergonomics,A method for effect modifier assessment (EMA) in ergonomic intervention research,article,EDWARDS2018113
"Pushing or pulling an object constitutes the majority of manual materials handling tasks. Anthropometric differences between workers alter pushing and pulling strategies at fixed heights, potentially modifying exposures and causing overexertion. Capability normalized to arm posture rather than work height remains unknown, and the purpose of this research was to quantify maximal pushing and pulling strength and upper extremity joint moments using fixed humeral abduction angles and a flexed arm position. Twenty university-aged females completed maximal pushes and pulls at 0Â°, 30Â°, 60Â°, 90Â°, and 120Â° of humeral abduction with an elbow to 90Â°. Abduction angle was the largest modifier of both push and pull force generating capability (pâ?¯<â?¯0.01), with increasing abduction reducing force capability by up to 30%. While push exertions on average exceeded pulls by 17â?¯N (pâ?¯<â?¯0.01), the difference is much smaller than previous reports. Ergonomists should consider humeral angle of the worker rather than work heights, as individuals working in increased abduction decreases capability and increases potential overexertion injury risk.","Shoulder biomechanics, Maximal strength, Ergonomics, Work design",Alan C.

"Tablet computersâ?? hardware and software designs may affect upper extremity muscle activity and postures. This study investigated the hypothesis that forearm muscle activity as well as wrist and thumb postures differ during simple gestures across different tablet form factors and touchscreen locations. Sixteen adult (8 female, 8 male) participants completed 320 tablet gestures across four swipe locations, with various tablet sizes (8â?³ and 10â?), tablet orientations (portrait and landscape), swipe orientations (vertical and horizontal), and swipe directions (medial and radial). Three-dimensional motion analysis and surface electromyography measured wrist and thumb postures and forearm muscle activity, respectively. Postures and muscle activity varied significantly across the four swipe locations (pâ?¯<â?¯.0001). Overall, swipe location closest to the palm allowed users to swipe with a more neutral thumb and wrist posture and required less forearm muscle activity. Greater thumb extension and abduction along with greater wrist extension and ulnar deviation was required to reach the target as the target moved farther from the palm. Extensor Carpi Radialis, Extensor Carpi Ulnaris, Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, Extensor Policis Brevis, and Abductor Pollicis Longus muscle activity also increased significantly with greater thumb reach (pâ?¯<â?¯001). Larger tablet size induced greater Extensor Carpi Radialis, Extensor Carpi Ulnaris, Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, Flexor Carpi Radialis, and Abductor Pollicis Longus muscle activity (pâ?¯<â?¯.0001). The study results demonstrate the importance of swipe locations and suggest that the tablet interface design can be improved to induce more neutral thumb and wrist posture along with lower forearm muscle load.","User interface design, Electromyography, Motion capture, Mobile computing",Sarah M.

"Poor sleep negatively impacts vigilance and is associated with reduced well-being and work productivity. While many individuals depend on caffeine to counteract the cognitive consequences of poor sleep and restore optimal work performance, few studies have naturalistically evaluated this strategy. This study examined the effects of coffee on vigilance, comparing individuals based on recent sleep quality. Sixty-nine participants completed two randomized, counterbalanced trials consisting of 237â?¯ml water or coffee (100â?¯mg caffeine), followed by a continuous performance test assessing vigilance at 30, 90, and 120â?¯min. While coffee improved and stabilized reaction time at all three assessments regardless of recent sleep history, its effects on omission and commission errors were seen only at 90â?¯min; coffee increased commission errors and only partially reduced omission errors in individuals reporting poor sleep quality. The use of coffee to combat poor sleep may therefore be detrimental in situations requiring inhibitory control.","Performance, Inhibitory control, Coffee, Sleep, Vigilance",Jason R.

"Preoperative briefings have been proven beneficial for improving team performance in the operating room. However, there has been minimal research regarding team briefings in specific surgical domains. As part of a larger project to develop a briefing structure for gynecological surgery, the study aimed to better understand the current state of pre-operative team briefings in one department of an academic hospital. Twenty-four team briefings were observed and video recorded. Communication was analyzed and social network metrics were created based on the team member verbal interactions. Introductions occurred in only 25% of the briefings. Network analysis revealed that average team briefings exhibited a hierarchical structure of communication, with the surgeon speaking the most frequently. The average network for resident-led briefings displayed a non-hierarchical structure with all team members communicating with the resident. Briefings conducted without a standardized protocol can produce variable communication between the role leading and the team members present.","Team briefings, Gynecological surgery, Communication",Katherine L.

"User interface (UI) design can affect the quality of decision making, where decisions based on digitally presented content are commonly informed by visually sampling information through eye movements. Analysis of the resulting scan patterns â?? the order in which people visually attend to different regions of interest (ROIs) â?? gives an insight into information foraging strategies. In this study, we quantified scan pattern characteristics for participants engaging with conceptually different user interface designs. Four interfaces were modified along two dimensions relating to effort in accessing information: data presentation (either alpha-numerical data or colour blocks), and information access time (all information sources readily available or sequential revealing of information required). The aim of the study was to investigate whether a) people develop repeatable scan patterns and b) different UI concepts affect information foraging and task performance. Thirty-two participants (eight for each UI concept) were given the task to correctly classify 100 credit card transactions as normal or fraudulent based on nine transaction attributes. Attributes varied in their usefulness of predicting the correct outcome. Conventional and more recent (network analysis- and bioinformatics-based) eye tracking metrics were used to quantify visual search. Empirical findings were evaluated in context of random data and possible accuracy for theoretical decision making strategies. Results showed short repeating sequence fragments within longer scan patterns across participants and conditions, comprising a systematic and a random search component. The UI design concept showing alpha-numerical data in full view resulted in most complete data foraging, while the design concept showing colour blocks in full view resulted in the fastest task completion time. Decision accuracy was not significantly affected by UI design. Theoretical calculations showed that the difference in achievable accuracy between very complex and simple decision making strategies was small. We conclude that goal-directed search of familiar information results in repeatable scan pattern fragments (often corresponding to information sources considered particularly important), but no repeatable complete scan pattern. The underlying concept of the UI affects how visual search is performed, and a decision making strategy develops. This should be taken in consideration when designing for applied domains.",,Sandra D.

"Sitting is the most common posture for work in offices, and spinal cord injury (SCI) patients who are wheelchair dependent spend 10.6â?¯h per day seated in wheelchairs. Thus, the comfort of subject-specific interfaces is increasingly important for the well-being of patients and office workers. This paper introduces a new method of forming a subject-specific interface, based on vibrating grains. Twenty subjects (10 females and 10 males) participated in the sitting test. Interface comfort was evaluated using the pressure distribution and subjective rating methods. Five seating interface types were compared. The results showed that compared with a flat interface, the interfaces formed by vibrating grains had a significantly reduced peak contact pressure (PeakCP) (by more than 58.03%), and that PeakCP was highly correlated with the comfort rating (Râ?¯=â?¯â??0.533) and discomfort rating(Râ?¯=â?¯â??0.603).

"The aim of this investigation was to compare the effect of three different stretchers (two powered and one manual) on the biomechanical and psychophysical demands experienced by paramedics when performing routine stretcher handling activities. Eight experienced paramedics performed stretcher raising, lowering, unloading and loading tasks. Video data of task performance and static force requirements were recorded and input into a posture matching program with a quasi-static linked segment model (3DMatch) to compute peak and cumulative L4/L5 compression and shear forces and shoulder moments during each activity. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded from paramedics upon the completion of each task. Use of powered stretchers with load assist functionality reduced the demands on paramedics. Peak L4/L5 forces were reduced by 13â??62% and 58â??93% for compression and shear respectively when using powered stretchers to perform routine stretcher handling activities. Shoulder flexor moments and RPE scores were reduced by 16â??95% and 29â??60% respectively when using the powered stretchers compared to the manual stretcher. However, cumulative forces showed mixed results. Although powered stretcher use decreased peak forces, loading and unloading a powered stretcher took 1.5 to 3.4 times longer then when using the manual stretcher, which may explain the mixed results regarding cumulative forces. Based on the RPE scores, paramedics preferred power stretchers relative to the manual stretcher. This study demonstrates that powered stretchers can reduce peak biomechanical and psychophysical exposures associated with the development of musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) during routine stretcher handling activities with minimal increases in cumulative exposures.","Physical ergonomics, Occupational biomechanics, Paramedics, Lifting, Equipment",Uma Lad and Nathalie M.C.W.

"Objective This study investigated the location of the axis of rotation in sagittal plane movement of the spine in a free sitting condition to adjust the kinematics of a mobile seat for a dynamic chair. Background Dynamic office chairs are designed to avoid continuous isometric muscle activity, and to facilitate increased mobility of the back during sitting. However, these chairs incorporate increased upper body movement which could distract office workers from the performance of their tasks. A chair with an axis of rotation above the seat would facilitate a stable upper back during movements of the lower back. The selection of a natural kinematic pattern is of high importance in order to match the properties of the spine. Method Twenty-one participants performed four cycles of flexion and extension of the spine during an upper arm hang on parallel bars. The location of the axis of rotation relative to the seat was estimated using infrared cameras and reflective skin markers. Results The median axis of rotation across all participants was located 36â?¯cm above the seat for the complete movement and 39â?¯cm for both the flexion and extension phases, each with an interquartile range of 20â?¯cm. Conclusion There was no significant effect of the movement direction on the location of the axis of rotation and only a weak, non-significant correlation between body height and the location of the axis of rotation. Individual movement patterns explained the majority of the variance. Application The axis of rotation for a spinal flexion/extension movement is located above the seat. The recommended radius for a guide rail of a mobile seat is between 36â?¯cm and 39â?¯cm.","Office workers, Dynamic sitting, Product design, Kinematics, Spine, Low back pain",C.M. Bauer and F.M.

"Adopting a new technology (exoskeletal vest designed to support overhead work) in the workplace can be challenging since the technology may pose unexpected safety and health consequences.

Donning/doffing the vest was easily done by a wearer alone. The vest reduced the max. shoulder abduction ROM by â?¼10%, and increased the mean center of pressure velocity in the anteroposterior direction by â?¼12%. However, vest use had minimal influences on trip-/slip-related fall risks during level walking, and significantly reduced spine loadings (up to â?¼30%) especially during the drilling task.

The study explored the influence of validity, placement, and style of comments in code on trustworthiness perceptions and time spent on code. Results indicated valid comments led to higher trust assessments and more time spent on the code. Properly placed comments led to lower trust assessments and had a marginal effect on time spent on code; however, the effect was no longer significant after controlling for effects of the source code. Low style comments led to marginally higher trustworthiness assessments, but high style comments led to longer time spent on the code. Several interactions were also found.

"The purpose of this study was to determine if vibration, a potential method of pain management, applied to the low back could alleviate pain developed during prolonged standing. Eighteen healthy individuals participated in a 2.5-h standing task during which vibration (3-min duration) was applied at the 2-h and 2.25-h marks. During the full 2.5Â h, participants recorded their perceived pain scores every 15Â min using a 10Â cm visual analogue scale (VAS). Following each vibration bout, those who developed low back pain (LPB) reported statistically lower VAS scores compared to prior to the vibration; however, when the vibration ceased, LBP returned to pre-vibration levels. It appears that vibration may be an effective method of alleviating LBP caused by prolonged standing; however, the effects seem to be temporary.

Additional themes about dose were related to communication, iterative solution development, participation and engagement. For program fidelity and satisfaction, themes emerged around engagement, capacity building and time demands. Conclusion Process evaluation revealed idiosyncratic approaches to recruitment and related challenges of reaching staff.

"This study examines the effect of traffic demand on driver workload by varying a range of characteristics of traffic behaviour, in particular focusing on the influence of a lane change performed by a neighbouring vehicle. To examine drivers' ability to manage their own workload in these traffic situations, a self-initiated, surrogate mobile phone task was presented to them, to coincide with changes in traffic demand. Results showed that whilst participants delayed the initiation of the task when the lane change was performed in close proximity to them, the delay was insufficient to mitigate the effects of the increased workload, leading to task errors. This was attributed to driver's willingness to engage in secondary tasks, even though their (self-reported) workload had not returned to baseline levels. The minimum workload recovery period was calculated as being 12Â s after the onset of the adjacent vehicle's manoeuvre, and this has implications for the design of workload managers.","Driving, Workload, Lane change, Secondary task, Demand",Evona Teh and Samantha Jamson and Oliver Carsten,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302089,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.09.012,0003-6870,2018,125--132,67,Applied Ergonomics,Mind the gap: Drivers underestimate the impact of the behaviour of other traffic on their workload,article,TEH2018125
"Since ironworkers walk and perform their tasks on steel beams, identifying the effects of slippery steel beam surfaces on ironworkers' gait stabilityâ??which can be related to safety riskâ??is critical.

Accordingly, to identify the relationships between coefficient of friction, perceived slipperiness, and gait stabilityâ??represented as the Maximum Lyaponuv exponent (Max LE)â??an experiment was conducted with eight different surfaces and sixteen subjects with varying experience as ironworkers. The experiment's results indicate that the slipperiness of the various surfaces greatly affect ironworkers' gait stability while they walk on coated steel beam surfaces. In detail, the Max LE of two subject groupsâ??experienced and inexperienced ironworkersâ??highly correlated with both the dynamic coefficient of friction values measured by following ANSI B101.3 and with the subjective rating scores of the inexperienced subject group. Unlike subjective rating scoresâ??which were particularly incongruent among experienced workersâ??the Max LE of inexperienced and experienced subjects has a consistent pattern. This study result highlights an opportunity for using gait stability measurements to quantify and differentiate the safety risks caused by slippery coated steel beams in the future.","Coefficient of friction, Perceived slipperiness, Maximum Lyapunov exponents",Hyunsoo Kim and Changbum R.

"The effect of spatial compatibility for various display-control configurations on human performance was studied with a dual-task paradigm using a tracking task and a discrete response task. Degradation of performance on both tasks within the visual modality was observed and was considered to be most likely due to resource competition resulting from simultaneous task operation. It was found that the more complicated the mapping for the discrete spatial compatibility response task, the more severe the interference with the tracking task. Although performance on both the tracking and spatial response tasks was impaired, the magnitude of impairment was not as great as expected, implying that focal and ambient vision required for the tracking task and spatial task, respectively, might be deployed, at least partly, from separate resources. Participants here seemed to successfully use focal vision for tracking and ambient vision for identifying signal lights concurrently, reducing the expected keen competition for visual resources.","Multitasking, Spatial S-R compatibility, Multiple resources, Displays and controls, Visual displays",Steve N.H.

"The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of various sensor fusion algorithms for measuring upper arm elevation relative to gravity (i.e., angular displacement and velocity summary measures) across different motion speeds. Thirteen participants completed a cyclic, short duration, arm-intensive work task that involved transfering wooden dowels at three work rates (slow, medium, fast). Angular displacement and velocity measurements of upper arm elevation were simultaneously measured using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and an optical motion capture (OMC) system. Results indicated that IMU-based inclinometer solutions can reduce root-mean-square errors in comparison to accelerometer-based inclination estimates by as much as 87%, depending on the work rate and sensor fusion approach applied. The findings suggest that IMU-based inclinometers can substantially improve inclinometer accuracy in comparison to traditional accelerometer-based inclinometers. Ergonomists may use the non-proprietary sensor fusion algorithms provided here to more accurately estimate upper arm elevation.","Inclinometer, Kalman filter, Inertial measurement units, Inertial-based motion capture",Howard Chen and Mark C.

"This study aimed at investigating the effect of two smartphone form factors (width and bottom bezel) on touch behaviors with one-handed interaction. User experiments on tapping tasks were conducted for four widths (67, 70, 72, and 74Â mm) and five bottom bezel levels (2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12.5Â mm). Task performance, electromyography, and subjective workload data were collected to examine the touch behavior. The success rate and task completion time were collected as task performance measures. The NASA-TLX method was used to observe the subjective workload. The electromyogram signals of two thumb muscles, namely the first dorsal interosseous and abductor pollicis brevis, were observed. The task performances deteriorated with increasing width level. The subjective workload and electromyography data showed similar patterns with the task performances. The task performances of the bottom bezel devices were analyzed by using three different evaluation criteria. The results from these criteria indicated that tasks became increasingly difficult as the bottom bezel level decreased. The results of this study provide insights into the optimal range of smartphone form factors for one-handed interaction, which could contribute to the design of new smartphones.","Smartphone form factor, Touch behavior performances, One-handed interaction",Seul Chan Lee and Min Chul Cha and Hwan Hwangbo and Sookhee Mo and Yong Gu Ji,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302247,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.10.002,0003-6870,2018,142--150,67,Applied Ergonomics,"Smartphone form factors: Effects of width and bottom bezel on touch performance, workload, and physical demand",article,LEE2018142
"Abstracts Objectives The objective of this study was to identify baseline predictors of disability and absenteeism in workers with a history of non-specific low back pain (LBP). Methods One hundred workers with a history of non-specific LBP participated in three evaluations (baseline, 7 and 15 months follow-up). Current and past history of LBP, clinical pain intensity, disability, absenteeism, fear-avoidance beliefs, pain catastrophizing, pain hypervigilance, work satisfaction and patient stratification based on â??risk of poor clinical outcome assessmentâ? (RPCO) were evaluated using questionnaires and interviews. In addition, cutaneous heat pain thresholds, cutaneous heat pain tolerance thresholds, conditioned pain modulation (CPM), trunk kinematics and muscle activity were measured during each evaluation. Logistic regression models were used to determine predictors of LBP disability and absenteeism at 15-months. Results Sixty-eight workers returned for the 15-month follow-up and among this sample, 49% reported disability and 16% reported absenteeism at follow-up. Baseline clinical pain intensity predicted disability (ORÂ =Â 1.08, 95%CI: 1.03â??1.13) at 15-month while work satisfaction (ORÂ =Â 0.93, 95%CI: 0.87â??0.99) and RPCO (ORÂ =Â 1.51, 95%CI: 1.05â??2.16) predicted absenteeism. These results remained significant after adjustments for age, gender as well as type of work and intervention. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of clinical pain and psychological factors in the prediction and potentially the prevention of future disability. Screening tools assessing these risk factors can be useful to evaluate workers with past history of low back pain.","Spinal pain, Neuromuscular adaptation, Pain inhibition, Psychological factors, Sick leave, Conditioned pain modulation, Pain perception",Arnaud Lardon and Jean-Daniel Dubois and Vincent Cantin and Mathieu PichÃ© and Martin Descarreaux,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302600,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.11.011,0003-6870,2018,176--185,68,Applied Ergonomics,Predictors of disability and absenteeism in workers with non-specific low back pain: A longitudinal 15-month study,article,LARDON2018176
"This paper presents a driving simulator study in which we investigated whether the Eye Tribe eye tracker (ET) is capable of assessing changes in the cognitive load of drivers through oculography and pupillometry. In the study, participants were asked to drive a simulated vehicle and simultaneously perform a set of secondary tasks with different cognitive complexity levels. We measured changes in eye properties, such as the pupil size, blink rate and fixation time. We also performed a measurement with a Detection Response Task (DRT) to validate the results and to prove a steady increase of cognitive load with increasing secondary task difficulty. The results showed that the ET precisely recognizes an increasing pupil diameter with increasing secondary task difficulty. In addition, the ET shows increasing blink rates, decreasing fixation time and narrowing of the attention field with increasing secondary task difficulty. The results were validated with the DRT method and the secondary task performance. We conclude that the Eye Tribe ET is a suitable device for assessing a driver's cognitive load.","Eye tracking, Pupillometry, Eye Tribe, Driver, Driving simulator, Cognitive load",TomaÅ¾ Ä?egovnik and Kristina Stojmenova and Grega Jakus and Jaka Sodnik,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302326,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.10.011,0003-6870,2018,1--11,68,Applied Ergonomics,An analysis of the suitability of a low-cost eye tracker for assessing the cognitive load of drivers,article,CEGOVNIK20181
"This article presents a workplace observations on manual work in cold environments and its impact on the selection of materials for protective gloves. The workplace observations was conducted on 107 workers in 7 companies and involved measurements of the temperature of air and objects in the workplaces; in addition the type of surface and shape of the objects was determined. Laboratory tests were also carried out on 11 materials for protective gloves to be used in cold environments. Protective characteristics, including mechanical properties (wear, cut, tear, and puncture resistance), insulation properties (thermal resistance), functional parameters, and hygienic properties (resistance to surface wetting, material stiffness) were evaluated. Appropriate levels of performance and quality, corresponding to the protective and functional properties of the materials, were determined. Based on the results of manual work and laboratory tests, directions for the selection of materials for the construction of protective gloves were formulated with a view to improving work ergonomics.","Protective gloves, Work in cold, Ergonomic factors",Emilia IrzmaÅ?ska and Paulina WÃ³jcik and Agnieszka {Adamus - WÅ?odarczyk},https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302569,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.11.007,0003-6870,2018,186--196,68,Applied Ergonomics,Manual work in cold environments and its impact on selection of materials for protective gloves based on workplace observations,article,IRZMANSKA2018186
"Background Upright and slouched sitting are frequently adopted postures associated with increased intradiscal pressure, spinal height loss and intervertebral disc pathology. Objectives To examine the effects of two sustained propped slouched sitting (PSS) postures on spinal height after a period of trunk loading. Methods Thirty-four participants without a history of low back pain (LBP) were recruited (age 24.4Â Â±Â 1.6 years). Subjects sat in (1) PSS without lumbar support and (2) PSS with lumbar support for 10Â min, after a period of trunk loading. Spinal height was measured using a stadiometer. Results Mean spinal height increase during PSS without lumbar support was 2.94Â Â±Â 3.63Â mm and with lumbar support 4.74Â Â±Â 3.07Â mm. Conclusions Both PSS with and without lumbar support significantly increased spinal height after a period of trunk loading (pÂ <Â 0.001). Such PSS postures can provide a valuable alternative to upright sitting and may be recommended for recovering spinal height in the working environment following periods of loading.","Spine, Ergonomics, Sitting posture",John L.

"Carsickness is associated with a mismatch between actual and anticipated sensory signals. Occupants of automated vehicles, especially when using a display, are at higher risk of becoming carsick than drivers of conventional vehicles. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of positioning of in-vehicle displays, and subsequent available peripheral vision, on carsickness of passengers. We hypothesized that increased peripheral vision during display use would reduce carsickness. Seated in the front passenger seat 18 participants were driven a 15-min long slalom on two occasions while performing a continuous visual search-task. The display was positioned either at 1) eye-height in front of the windscreen, allowing peripheral view on the outside world, and 2) the height of the glove compartment, allowing only limited view on the outside world. Motion sickness was reported at 1-min intervals. Using a display at windscreen height resulted in less carsickness compared to a display at glove compartment height.","Motion sickness, Displays, Autonomous vehicles",Ouren X. Kuiper and Jelte E.

"This study investigated the acute effects of changing the work pace and implementing two pause types during an assembly task. Eighteen healthy women performed a simulated task in four different conditions: 1) slow or 2) fast work pace with 3) passive or 4) active pauses every two minutes. The root mean square (RMS) and exposure variation analysis (EVA) from the trapezius and serratus anterior muscles, as well as the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) from the neck-shoulder region, were observed. Decreased RMS and RPE as well as more variable muscle activity (EVA) were observed in the slow work pace compared with the fast one. The pause types had a limited effect, but active pauses resulted in increased RMS of the clavicular trapezius. The findings revealed the importance of work pace in the reduction of perceived exertion and promotion of variation in muscle activation during assembly tasks. However, the pause types had no important effect on the evaluated outcomes.","Surface electromyography, Neck-shoulder, Work, Assembly task",Leticia Bergamin Januario and Pascal Madeleine and Marina Machado Cid and Afshin Samani and Ana Beatriz Oliveira,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701730193X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.08.011,0003-6870,2018,151--160,66,Applied Ergonomics,Can exposure variation be promoted in the shoulder girdle muscles by modifying work pace and inserting pauses during simulated assembly work?,article,JANUARIO2018151
"The unique geographical location of Hainan makes its climate characteristics different from inland areas in China. The thermal comfort of Hainan also owes its uniqueness to its tropical island climate. In the past decades, there have been very few studies on thermal comfort of the residents in tropical island areas in China. A thermal environment test for different types of buildings in Hainan and a thermal comfort field investigation of 1944 subjects were conducted over a period of about two months. The results of the survey data show that a high humidity environment did not have a significant impact on human comfort. The neutral temperature for the residents in tropical island areas was 26.1Â Â°C, and the acceptable temperature range of thermal comfort was from 23.1Â Â°C to 29.1Â Â°C. Residents living in tropical island areas showed higher heat resistance capacity, but lower cold tolerance than predicted. The neutral temperature for females (26.3Â Â°C) was higher than for males (25.8Â Â°C). Additionally, females were more sensitive to air temperature than males. The research conclusions can play a guiding role in the thermal environment design of green buildings in Hainan Province.","Tropical island, Thermal comfort temperature, Thermal neutral temperature, Non-air-conditioned buildings, Building energy efficiency",Shilei Lu and Bo Pang and Yunfang Qi and Kun Fang,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017301904,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.08.008,0003-6870,2018,89--97,66,Applied Ergonomics,Field study of thermal comfort in non-air-conditioned buildings in a tropical island climate,article,LU201889
"The vibration isolation performances of vibration reducing (VR) gloves are invariably assessed in terms of power tools' handle vibration transmission to the palm of the hand using the method described in ISO 10819 (2013), while the nature of vibration transmitted to the fingers is ignored. Moreover, the VR gloves with relatively low stiffness viscoelastic materials affect the grip strength in an adverse manner. This study is aimed at performance assessments of 12 different VR gloves on the basis of handle vibration transmission to the palm and the fingers of the gloved hand, together with reduction in the grip strength. The gloves included 3 different air bladder, 3 gel, 3 hybrid, and 2 gel-foam gloves in addition to a leather glove. Two Velcro finger adapters, each instrumented with a three-axis accelerometer, were used to measure vibration responses of the index and middle fingers near the mid-phalanges. Vibration transmitted to the palm was measured using the standardized palm adapter. The vibration transmissibility responses of the VR gloves were measured in the laboratory using the instrumented cylindrical handle, also described in the standard, mounted on a vibration exciter. A total of 12 healthy male subjects participated in the study. The instrumented handle was also used to measure grip strength of the subjects with and without the VR gloves. The results of the study showed that the VR gloves, with only a few exceptions, attenuate handle vibration transmitted to the fingers only in the 10â??200Â Hz and amplify middle finger vibration at frequencies exceeding 200Â Hz. Many of the gloves, however, provided considerable reduction in vibration transmitted to the palm, especially at higher frequencies. These suggest that the characteristics of vibration transmitted to fingers differ considerably from those at the palm. Four of the test gloves satisfied the screening criteria of the ISO 10819 (2013) based on the palm vibration alone, even though these caused amplification of handle vibration at the fingers. The fingers' vibration transmission performance of gloves were further evaluated using a proposed finger frequency-weighting Wf apart from the standardized Wh-weighting. It is shown that the Wh weighting generally overestimates the VR glove effectiveness in limiting the fingers vibration in the high (H: 200â??1250Â Hz) frequency range. Both the weightings, however, revealed comparable performance of gloves in the mid (M: 25â??200Â Hz) frequency range. The VR gloves, with the exception of the leather glove, showed considerable reductions in the grip strength (27â??41%), while the grip strength reduction was not correlated with the glove material thickness. It is suggested that effectiveness of VR gloves should be assessed considering the vibration transmission to both the palm and fingers of the hand together with the hand grip strength reduction.","Anti-vibration glove, Vibration transmissibility, Hand-transmitted vibration, Hand-arm vibration, Finger vibration, Frequency-weighting",K.

"Low back and neck/shoulder pain are commonly reported among reforestation hand planters. While some studies have documented the intensive cardiovascular demands of hand planting, limited information is available regarding exposures to physical risk factors associated with the development of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among hand planters. This study used surface electromyography (EMG) and inertial measurement units (IMUs) to characterize the muscle activation patterns, upper arm and trunk postures, movement velocities, and physical activity (PA) of fourteen Southeastern reforestation hand planters over one work shift. Results indicated that hand planters are exposed to physical risk factors such as extreme trunk postures (32.5% of time spent in â?¥45Â° trunk flexion) and high effort muscle exertions (e.g., mean root-mean-square right upper trapezius amplitude of 54.1% reference voluntary exertion) that may place them at increased risk for developing MSDs. The findings indicate a need for continued field-based research among hand planters to identify and/or develop maximally effective interventions.","Musculoskeletal disorders, Posture, Physical activity, Low back, Shoulder, Inertial measurement unit",Robert F.

"Aim The aim of the present study was to utilise a systems thinking approach to explore the perceived responsibilities for identifying and treating concussion held by different actors across the community rugby system (e.g., players, coaches, parents, medics, referees, and management), as well as their role-specific concussion management strategies. Methods A systems approach was taken to assess what different stakeholders within rugby systems perceive their roles to be regarding concussion identification and treatment. Through an online survey, 118 members of the amateur (community) rugby union system were asked about their role-specific concussion management responsibilities and strategies. Respondents included players, parents, medics, coaches, club managers, administrators, and volunteers. Results The majority of respondents indicated that they were able to identify the symptoms of rugby-related concussion, however, only medics stated their responsibility to use formal concussion assessments (e.g., SCAT2). A smaller number of the respondents indicated that they were involved in treating concussion within their current role/s (majority of which were medics). Conclusions This study illustrated that the current challenges in the identification and treatment of rugby-related concussion in community sport may be due to role/responsibility confusion and possible overreliance on field-side medics. These findings offer insight into the possible limitations of the current concussion management guidelines and may offer empirically based direction for future revisions.","Systems thinking, Concussion, Injury management, Sport-related injury, Rugby union",Amanda Clacy and Natassia Goode and Rachael Sharman and Geoff P.

"The systems approach is increasingly used as a framework within which to examine safety climate. Utilizing a macroergonomics approach to design work systems can help identify aspects of human-technology-organization interfaces that impact workersâ?? perceptions of safety, both positively and negatively. Such an approach also supplements traditional uses of safety climate as a leading indicator of safety and helps expand research toward an approach that can determine problems impacting safety. The purpose of this study was to develop a methodology that extends safety climate beyond just an overall score by using the framework of macroergonomics to examine the entire system in a more comprehensive manner. The proposed methodology can be used as a way to identify gaps in the specific work system, and this information can be used to design interventions to change the safety climate, and ultimately the culture, of an organization in order to reduce negative safety outcomes.","Macroergonomics, Safety climate, Sociotechnical systems theory",Lauren A.

"The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal inner-shoe volume for children tennis players. Sixteen participants, aged from 8 to 12 years old assessed comfort of 6 shoes, which were a combination of 3 lasts (thin, medium and wide) and 2 upper constructions (flexible and stiff), while a sock equipped with textile sensors was measuring the pressure applied on their foot. The thin last was based on the proportion of an adult last. The widest shoes produced the lowest pressure on the 1st and 5th metatarsal heads, the medial midfoot and the medial and lateral heel (pÂ <Â 0.05), whilst they were perceived the most comfortable for the 3rd and 5th metatarsal heads, the 5th metatarsal base and the medial and lateral heel (pÂ <Â 0.05).

"To plan a new manual material handling work process, it is necessary to predict the times required to complete each task. Current time prediction models lack validity when the handled object's mass exceeds 2Â kg. In this study, we investigated the effect of workplace design parameters on continuous sequential lifting, carrying, and lowering of boxes weighing from 2Â kg to 14Â kg. Both laboratory and field experiments were conducted. Results revealed that the box's weight and the lifting and lowering heights influenced the tasks' times. Further, the time to perform a task was influenced by the performance of other tasks in the same work process. New time prediction models were developed using the laboratory experiment data. Our models were found to be more accurate on average than the Maynard Operation Sequence Technique (MOST) and Methods Time Measurement (MTM-1) by 42% and 20%, respectively, for predicting the times of real workers at an actual workplace.","Manual material handling, Time prediction models, Workplace design",Yaar Harari and Raziel Riemer and Avital Bechar,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017301990,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.09.003,0003-6870,2018,61--70,67,Applied Ergonomics,"Factors determining workers' pace while conducting continuous sequential lifting, carrying, and lowering tasks",article,HARARI201861
"A polar supply and research vessel is pre-disposed to wave slamming which has caused complaints among crew and researchers regarding interference with sleep, equipment use and research activities. The present work undertook to survey passenger claims of sleep interference, disturbed motor tasks and equipment damage as a result of wave slamming during normal operations of this vessel. The hypothesis was investigated that whole-body vibration metrics from ISO 2631-1 are potentially suitable for the prediction of human slamming complaints. Full-scale acceleration measurements were performed and wave slamming events were subsequently identified from the human weighted acceleration time histories. A daily diary survey was also conducted to gather the human response. The vibration caused by wave slamming was found to be strongly correlated with sleep disturbances and activity interference. Sleep and equipment use were found to be the most affected parameters by slamming. Daily vibration dose values were determined by accumulating the vibration as a result of slamming over 24Â h periods. This metric accounted for increased magnitudes and frequency of slamming incidents and proved to be the best metric to represent human responses to slamming vibration. The greatest percentage of activities affected by slamming related to sleep regardless of daily cumulative VDV magnitude. More than 50% of the recorded responses related to sleep when the daily cumulative VDV ranged between 8.0Â m/s1.75â??10.0Â m/s1.75. The peak vertical vibration levels recorded on the vessel reach magnitudes which are associated with sleep disturbance in environments where acoustic noise is present.","Wave slamming, Whole-body vibration, Human response survey, Vibration dose value, Ice-going stern design",H.

After reading from the smartphone, total symptom scores and nine out of ten questionnaire symptoms were significantly worse than for the hardcopy (â??blurred vision while viewing the text, â??blurred distance vision after the taskâ?, â??difficulty in refocusing from one distance to anotherâ?, â??irritated or burning eyesâ?, â??dry eyesâ?, â??eyestrainâ?, â??tired eyesâ?, â??sensitivity to bright lightsâ? and â??eye discomfortâ?). Mean total symptom scores and scores for â??irritated or burning eyesâ? and â??dry eyesâ? were significantly higher for the dark versus photopic conditions. In conclusion, prolonged smartphone reading could cause worse asthenopic symptoms than reading from a hardcopy under similar conditions. Symptoms could be even worse when reading from a smartphone in the dark.","Smartphone, Asthenopia symptom, Reading, Dark environment",Beatriz Antona and Ana Rosa Barrio and Adriana GascÃ³ and Ana Pinar and Mariano GonzÃ¡lez-PÃ©rez and MarÃ­a C.

"The automation of longitudinal and lateral control has enabled drivers to become â??hands and feet freeâ? but they are required to remain in an active monitoring state with a requirement to resume manual control if required. This represents the single largest allocation of system function problem with vehicle automation as the literature suggests that humans are notoriously inefficient at completing prolonged monitoring tasks. To further explore whether partially automated driving solutions can appropriately support the driver in completing their new monitoring role, video observations were collected as part of an on-road study using a Tesla Model S being operated in Autopilot mode. A thematic analysis of video data suggests that drivers are not being properly supported in adhering to their new monitoring responsibilities and instead demonstrate behaviour indicative of complacency and over-trust. These attributes may encourage drivers to take more risks whilst out on the road.","Automated driving, Driver role, Level of automation, Partial automation, Mode transitions, Transitions of control",Victoria A.

"This study evaluated the effect of physical, psychosocial and individual factors on the presence of musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS) among surgeons (nÂ =Â 312) in Iran. Data were collected using questionnaires and analysed by multivariate logistic regression. The prevalence of MSS, particularly in the knees (48.7%), neck (45.8%), low back (42.3%) and shoulders (40.1%) was relatively high. Work-related factors including time spent on surgeries each week (>25Â h/week), number of hours working in standing position per day (>4Â h/day), moderate to high levels of workâ??family conflict, duration of each surgery (>3Â h), number of years worked as a surgeon (>10 years) and surgical specialty (particularly cardiothoracic and obstetric/gynecologic surgeries) were independently associated with the presence of MSS in different body regions. Individual factors including gender (being female) and little or no involvement in sport and physical activity were also independently associated with the occurrence of complaints. Implications of the findings for further research and development work for improving the working conditions and consequently reducing MSS among this working group are discussed.","Operating room, Surgeon, Pain, Discomfort, MSDs",Iman Dianat and Ahmad Bazazan and Mohammad Amin {Souraki Azad} and Seyedeh Sakineh Salimi,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302077,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.09.011,0003-6870,2018,115--124,67,Applied Ergonomics,"Work-related physical, psychosocial and individual factors associated with musculoskeletal symptoms among surgeons: Implications for ergonomic interventions",article,DIANAT2018115

"Intraocular pressure (IOP) has been investigated as a possible objective index of mental stressors. Here, we assessed the effect of examination stress on IOP in 33 university students. A repeated-measures design was used with two experimental conditions (examination and control) and two points of measurements (pre- and post-sessions). Also, the cardiovascular response, subjective perceived stress, as well as calculated ocular perfusion pressure and blood-pulse pressure were determined. A Bayesian statistical analysis showed higher IOP values in the examination in comparison to the control condition (BF01â?¯<â?¯0.001). A similar pattern was found for the cardiovascular indices (diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and heart rate), and these findings were corroborated by subjective reports (BF01â?¯<â?¯0.001 in all cases).

"The objective of this study was to investigate biomechanical loading to the low back as a result of wearing an exoskeletal intervention designed to assist in occupational work. Twelve subjects simulated the use of two powered hand tools with and without the use of a Steadicam vest with an articulation tool support arm in a laboratory environment. Dependent measures of peak and mean muscle forces in ten trunk muscles and peak and mean spinal loads were examined utilizing a dynamic electromyography-assisted spine model. The exoskeletal device increased both peak and mean muscle forces in the torso extensor muscles (pÂ <Â 0.001). Peak and mean compressive spinal loads were also increased up to 52.5% and 56.8%, respectively, for the exoskeleton condition relative to the control condition (pÂ <Â 0.001).

"Crowds are a commonplace encounter but the experience for participants can be highly variable. Crowds are complex sociotechnical phenomenon, affected by many interacting factors. Little is known, however, about how those responsible for organising crowd situations approach their responsibilities. This study conducted semi-structured interviews (nÂ =Â 41) with organisers responsible for different aspects of the design, planning, management and operations of events and other crowd situations. The objective was to understand organisers' priorities, along with the consideration given to the experience of crowd participants. The interviews revealed that organisers generally prioritised finance, security and health and safety aspects, whilst giving limited explicit attention to other important factors that affect participant experience. Organisers tended to approach their planning and decisions on the basis of their own experience and judgement, without accessing training or reference to guidance. It is suggested that the non-use of guidance is in part due to problems with the guidance currently available, both its content and its form. The organisers of infrequent or small-scale events have the greatest knowledge and experience gap. It is concluded that in order to achieve a consistent, high quality experience for crowd participants, there needs to be improved understanding among organisers of the complexity of crowds and the multiple factors influencing participant experience. Guidance and tools need to be usable and tailored to organisersâ?? requirements. Organisers of infrequent or small-scale events are especially in need of support.","Event planning, Event organisation, Crowd ergonomics",Victoria Filingeri and Ken Eason and Patrick Waterson and Roger Haslam,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368701730234X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.10.013,0003-6870,2018,18--27,68,Applied Ergonomics,Factors influencing experience in crowds â??

"With technological developments in robotics and their increasing deployment, human-robot teams are set to be a mainstay in the future. To develop robots that possess teaming capabilities, such as being able to communicate implicitly, the present study implemented a closed-loop system. This system enabled the robot to provide adaptive aid without the need for explicit commands from the human teammate, through the use of multiple physiological workload measures. Such measures of workload vary in sensitivity and there is large inter-individual variability in physiological responses to imposed taskload. Workload models enacted via closed-loop system should accommodate such individual variability. The present research investigated the effects of the adaptive robot aid vs. imposed aid on performance and workload. Results showed that adaptive robot aid driven by an individualized workload model for physiological response resulted in greater improvements in performance compared to aid that was simply imposed by the system.","Adaptive systems, Workload model, Inter-individual variability",Grace Teo and Lauren Reinerman-Jones and Gerald Matthews and James Szalma and Florian Jentsch and Peter Hancock,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017301618,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.07.007,0003-6870,2018,91--103,67,Applied Ergonomics,Enhancing the effectiveness of human-robot teaming with a closed-loop system,article,TEO201891
"Background We sought to evaluate potential mediators of the relationship between heat exposure and traumatic injuries in outdoor agricultural workers. Methods Linear mixed models were used to estimate associations between maximum work-shift Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGTmax) and post-shift vigilance (reaction time) and postural sway (total path length) in a cross-sectional sample of 46 Washington State tree fruit harvesters in Augustâ??September 2015. Results The mean (SD) WBGTmax was 27.4 (3.2)Â°C in August and 21.2 (2.0)Â°C in September. The mean pre-work-shift participant urine specific gravity indicated minimal dehydration. Twenty-four percent of participants exhibited possible excessive sleepiness. There was no association between WBGTmax and post-shift reaction time or total path length. Conclusions Heat exposure was not associated with impaired vigilance or balance in this study, in which the overall mean (SD) WBGTmax was 25.9 (4.2)Â°C. However, the study identified opportunities to ensure adequate pre-work-shift hydration and to optimize sleep and work-shift timing in order to reduce occupational injury and heat-related illness risk.","Heat exposure, Postural sway, Psychomotor vigilance",June T.

"Kinematics at heel strike instant (HSI) has been used to quantify slip severity. However, methods to identify HSI remain ambiguous and have not been evaluated under slippery conditions. A glass force plate was used to observe the contact interface between shoe and floor under slippery conditions. HSIs identified from the video captured beneath the force plate and from the force plate and kinematics were compared. The results showed that HSIs identified with the video were closer to those identified with the normal force threshold (NFT) (9.0Â msÂ Â±Â 5.5Â ms) than were most of those identified with kinematics. Slips with a longer distance travelled between NFT HSI and video HSI had a larger heel horizontal velocity (>0.8Â m/s) and a smaller foot angular velocity (<100deg/s) at the NFT instant, and were still part of the forward swing. The results show that improved methods are needed over NFT to identify HSI, especially under slippery conditions.","Heel contact, High speed camera, Kinematics, Force plate",Wen-Ruey Chang and Xu Xu,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017301746,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.08.004,0003-6870,2018,32--40,66,Applied Ergonomics,Identification of heel strike under a slippery condition,article,CHANG201832
"This laboratory experiment was designed to study the effect of metacognitive monitoring feedback on performance in a computer-based training simulation. According to prior research on metacognition, the accurate checking of learning is a critical part of improving the quality of human performance. However, only rarely have researchers studied the learning effects of the accurate checking of retrospective confidence judgments (RCJs) during a computer-based military training simulation. In this study, we provided participants feedback screens after they had completed a warning task and identification task in a radar monitoring simulation. There were two groups in this experiment. One group (group A) viewed the feedback screens with the flight path of all target aircraft and the triangular graphs of both RCJ scores and human performance together. The other group (group B) only watched the feedback screens with the flight path of all target aircraft. There was no significant difference in performance improvement between groups A and B for the warning task (Day 1: group A â?? 0.347, group B â?? 0.305; Day 2: group A â?? 0.488, group B â?? 0.413). However, the identification task yielded a significant difference in performance improvement between these groups (Day 1: group A â?? 0.174, group B â?? 0.1555; Day 2: group A â?? 0.324, group B â?? 0.199). The results show that debiasing self-judgment of the identification task produces a positive training effect on learners. The findings of this study will be beneficial for designing an advanced instructional strategy in a simulation-based training environment.","Retrospective confidence judgments, Computer-based training, Human-in-the-loop simulation, Human performance",Jung Hyup Kim,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302272,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.10.006,0003-6870,2018,193--202,67,Applied Ergonomics,The effect of metacognitive monitoring feedback on performance in a computer-based training simulation,article,KIM2018193
"This study applied Social Network Analysis (SNA) to test whether advice-seeking interactions among peers about safe patient handling correlate with a higher frequency of equipment use. Patient-care workers (n=38) at a community hospital in Oregon nominated peers they would consult for advice regarding safe patient handling. Results show a positive correlation between identifying more peers for safe patient handling advice and using equipment more frequently. Moreover, nurses with more reciprocal advice seeking nominations used safe patient handling equipment more frequently. However, employees who would be more consulted about safe patient handling by their peers did not use equipment more frequently than nurses with fewer nominations. Despite the small sample size, the magnitude of the adjusted regressions coefficients ranged between 3 to 4 standard deviations. These results suggest that having more or reciprocal sources of peer-based support may trigger ergonomic related behaviors such as frequent utilization of equipment.","Safe patient handling, Social Network Analysis, Safety behaviors, Peer support, Social support",David A.

"Objective Complex medical devices such as infusion pumps are increasingly being used in patientsâ?? homes with little known about the impact on patient safety. Our aim was to better understand the risks to patient safety in this situation and how these risks might be minimised, by reference to incident reports. Design We identified 606 records of incidents associated with infusion devices that had occurred in a private home and were reported to the UK National Reporting and Learning Service (2005â??2015 inclusive). We used thematic analysis to identify key themes. Results In this paper we focus on two emergent themes: detecting and diagnosing incidents; and locating the patient, lay caregivers and their family in incident reports. The majority of incidents were attributed to device malfunction, and resulted in the patient being under-dosed. Delays in recognising and responding to problems were identified, alongside challenges in identifying the cause. We propose a process model for fault diagnosis and correction. Patients and caregivers did not feature strongly in reports; we highlight how the device is in the home but of the care system, and propose an agent model to describe this; we also identify ways of mitigating this disjoint. Conclusion Devices need to be appropriately tailored to the setting in which they are employed, and within a system of care that ensures they are used optimally and safely. Suggested features to improve patient safety include devices that can provide better feedback to identify problems and support resolution, alongside greater monitoring and technical support by care providers for both patients and frontline professionals. The proposed process and agent models provide a structure for reviewing safety and learning from incidents in home health care.","Patient safety, Incident reporting, Qualitative research, Primary care, Infusion devices",Imogen Lyons and Ann Blandford,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302065,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.09.010,0003-6870,2018,104--114,67,Applied Ergonomics,"Safer healthcare at home: Detecting, correcting and learning from incidents involving infusion devices",article,LYONS2018104
"Our aim was to identify implementation components for sustainable working environment interventions in the nursing assistant sector to generate a framework to optimize the implementation of workplace improvement initiatives.

"This study attempted to investigate the effects of the target shape and the movement direction on the pointing time using an eye-gaze input system and extend Fitts' model so that these factors are incorporated into the model and the predictive power of Fitts' model is enhanced. The target shape, the target size, the movement distance, and the direction of target presentation were set as within-subject experimental variables. The target shape included: a circle, and rectangles with an aspect ratio of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4. The movement direction included eight directions: upper, lower, left, right, upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right. On the basis of the data for identifying the effects of the target shape and the movement direction on the pointing time, an attempt was made to develop a generalized and extended Fittsâ?? model that took into account the movement direction and the target shape. As a result, the generalized and extended model was found to fit better to the experimental data, and be more effective for predicting the pointing time for a variety of human-computer interaction (HCI) task using an eye-gaze input system.","HCI, Fitts' modeling, Pointing time, Eye-gaze input system, Target shape, Movement direction",Atsuo Murata and Daichi Fukunaga,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302466,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.10.019,0003-6870,2018,54--60,68,Applied Ergonomics,Extended Fittsâ?? model of pointing time in eye-gaze input system - Incorporating effects of target shape and movement direction into modeling,article,MURATA201854
"In automated driving, a driver can completely concentrate on non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs). This study investigated the flow experience of a driver who concentrated on NDRTs and tasks that induce mental workload under conditional automation. Participants performed NDRTs under different demand levels: a balanced demandâ??skill level (fit condition) to induce flow, low-demand level to induce boredom, and high-demand level to induce anxiety. In addition, they performed the additional N-Back task, which artificially induces mental workload. The results showed participants had the longest reaction time when they indicated the highest flow score, and had the longest gaze-on time, road-fixation time, hands-on time, and take-over time under the fit condition. Significant differences were not observed in the driver reaction times in the fit condition and the additional N-Back task, indicating that performing NDRTs that induce a high flow experience could influence driver reaction time similar to performing tasks with a high mental workload.","Automated driving, Flow experience, Take-over time, Eye-tracking, NASA-TLX",Sang Min Ko and Yong Gu Ji,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302302,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.10.009,0003-6870,2018,237--245,67,Applied Ergonomics,How we can measure the non-driving-task engagement in automated driving: Comparing flow experience and workload,article,KO2018237
"Several crash reports have identified in-vehicle distraction to be a primary cause of emergency vehicle crashes especially in law enforcement. Furthermore, studies have found that mobile computer terminals (MCTs) are the most frequently used in-vehicle technology for police officers. Twenty police officers participated in a driving simulator-based assessment of visual behavior, performance, workload and situation awareness with current and enhanced MCT interface designs. In general, results revealed MCT use while driving to decrease officer visual attention to the roadway, but usability improvements can reduce the level of visual distraction and secondary-task completion time. Results also suggest that use of MCTs while driving significantly reduces perceived level of driving environment awareness for police officers and increases cognitive workload. These findings may be useful for MCT manufacturers in improving interface designs to increase police officer and civilian safety.","Mobile computer terminal, Driver performance, Attention allocation, Workload, Situation awareness",Maryam Zahabi and David Kaber,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.09.006,0003-6870,2018,26--38,67,Applied Ergonomics,Effect of police mobile computer terminal interface design on officer driving distraction,article,ZAHABI201826
"Highly automated driving will change driver's behavioural patterns. Traditional methods used for assessing manual driving will only be applicable for the parts of human-automation interaction where the driver intervenes such as in hand-over and take-over situations. Therefore, driver behaviour assessment will need to adapt to the new driving scenarios. This paper aims at simplifying the process of selecting appropriate assessment methods. Thirty-five papers were reviewed to examine potential and relevant methods. The review showed that many studies still relies on traditional driving assessment methods. A new method, the Failure-GAM2E model, with purpose to aid assessment selection when planning a study, is proposed and exemplified in the paper. Failure-GAM2E includes a systematic step-by-step procedure defining the situation, failures (Failure), goals (G), actions (A), subjective methods (M), objective methods (M) and equipment (E). The use of Failure-GAM2E in a study example resulted in a well-reasoned assessment plan, a new way of measuring trust through feet movements and a proposed Optimal Risk Management Model.

"Three-dimensional (3D) body scanners have the potential to evaluate changes to the human form through different clothing configurations, the use of protective equipment, or the effects of medical interventions. To achieve this, scans of an individual need to be superimposed for each experimental condition. The literature highlights that one of the limiting factors is postural variability. This paper describes a newly developed â??positioning aidâ?? that stabilises the posture during the scanning process and is invisible on scans. The results of a study evaluating the efficacy of the positioning aid showed that it reduces postural variability for all body parts in lateral and longitudinal directions. A reference test with a rigid mannequin indicated that the â??technicalâ?? variability due to the scanner hardware and software significantly contributes to the residual variability. Furthermore, the study showed that the newly developed positioning aid overall increased the precision of the software-assisted extraction of body dimensions.","Body scanner, Posture, Precision, Positioning aid",Frank Schwarz-MÃ¼ller and Russell Marshall and Steve Summerskill,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302508,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.11.001,0003-6870,2018,90--100,68,Applied Ergonomics,Development of a positioning aid to reduce postural variability and errors in 3D whole body scan measurements,article,SCHWARZMULLER201890
"Safety leadership is an important factor in supporting safe performance in the workplace. The present case study examined the role of safety leadership during the Bingham Canyon Mine high-wall failure, a significant mining incident in which no fatalities or injuries were incurred. The Critical Decision Method (CDM) was used in conjunction with a self-reporting approach to examine safety leadership in terms of decisions, behaviours and actions that contributed to the incidents' safe outcome. Mapping the analysis onto Rasmussen's Risk Management Framework (Rasmussen, 1997), the findings demonstrate clear links between safety leadership decisions, and emergent behaviours and actions across the work system. Communication and engagement based decisions featured most prominently, and were linked to different leadership practices across the work system. Further, a core sub-set of CDM decision elements were linked to the open flow and exchange of information across the work system, which was critical to supporting the safe outcome. The findings provide practical implications for the development of safety leadership capability to support safety within the mining industry.","Safety leadership, Decisions, Behaviours, Actions, Systems-thinking, Mining",Sarah-Louise Donovan and Paul M.

"This study aimed to assess whether modifying the pitch of a 75Â° ladder ergometer to vertical had a cardiorespiratory or psychophysical effect on climbing. Nine male participants climbed a ladder ergometer at 75Â° and subsequently at 90Â°, adjusted for an equivalent vertical climb rate, completing three climbing bouts at different vertical speeds. One participant dropped out being unable to complete the climb under the 90Â° condition. Each was monitored for heart rate (HR), VË?O2 and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Results showed vertical climbing induced higher VË?O2 (mean increase 17.3%), higher HR (mean increase 15.8%), and higher RPE at all speeds and that moving from 75Â°to vertical exacerbates the effect of speed on the cardiorespiratory response to climbing. This may be explained by increased force production required to maintain balance in a vertical climbing position when the body's centre of mass is not above the feet.","Ladder ergometer, Pitched ladder climbing, Vertical ladder climbing, Ladder climbing physiology",P.J.

"Stair ascending performance is critical during evacuation from buildings and underground infrastructures. Healthy subjects performed self-paced ascent in three settings: 13 floor building, 31 floor building, 33Â m stationary subway escalator. To investigate leg muscle and cardiorespiratory capacities and how they constrain performance, oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR) and ascending speed were measured in all three; electromyography (EMG) in the first two. The VO2 and HR ranged from 89 to 96% of the maximum capacity reported in the literature. The average highest VO2 and HR ranged from 39 to 41Â mLÂ·kgâ??1Â·minâ??1 and 162 to 174Â bÂ·minâ??1, respectively. The subjects were able to sustain their initial preferred maximum pace for a short duration, while the average step rate was 92â??95 stepsÂ·minâ??1. In average, VO2 reached relatively stable values at â??37Â mLÂ·kgâ??1Â·minâ??1. EMG amplitudes decreased significantly and frequencies were unchanged. Speed reductions indicate that climbing capacity declined in the process of fatigue development. In the two buildings, the reduction of muscle power allowed the subjects to extend their tolerance and complete ascents in the 48Â m and 109Â m high stairways in 2.9 and 7.8Â min, respectively. Muscle activity interpretation squares were developed and proved advantageous to observe fatigue and recovery over time.","Physical capacity, Stair climbing, Oxygen consumption, Electromyography, Muscle fatigue",Amitava Halder and Kalev Kuklane and Chuansi Gao and Michael Miller and Mattias Delin and Johan NorÃ©n and Karl Fridolf,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017301734,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.08.003,0003-6870,2018,52--63,66,Applied Ergonomics,Limitations of oxygen uptake and leg muscle activity during ascending evacuation in stairways,article,HALDER201852
"The research-practice gap has been highlighted as a barrier to effective practice in human factors and ergonomics (HFE). There is also evidence of a theory-research gap that may be limiting the scientific evidence base of HFE. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in journal publications, especially relating to the research-practice gap and the involvement of theory over time. A content analysis was conducted on 425 journal articles published in Human Factors, Ergonomics, and Applied Ergonomics from 1960 to 2010. Results showed evidence of growth in applied research with increasing collaborative research between research and industry, larger research teams, and more empirical researchâ??especially on applied problems. While there has been a corresponding increase in the involvement of theory in HFE publications, around half of the publications failed to acknowledge theory. This calls into question whether the HFE discipline may be missing the benefits of theory to guide research and subsequent practice, and to enhance the development of new ideas.","Research publications, Theory, Practice",Amy Z.Q.

"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of holding external loads on postural sway during upright stance across age decades. Sixty-five healthy adults (females, nÂ =Â 35), aged 18â??80 years were assessed in four conditions; (1) standing without holding a load, holding a load corresponding to 5% body mass in the (2) left hand, (3) right hand and (4) both hands. The centre of pressure (COP) path length and anteroposterior and mediolateral COP displacement were used to indirectly assess postural sway. External loading elicited reductions in COP measures of postural sway in older age groups only (PÂ <Â 0.05). No changes were observed in younger or intermediate aged adults (PÂ >Â 0.05). Holding external loads during standing is relevant to many activities of daily living (i.e. holding groceries). The reduction in postural sway may suggest this type of loading has a stabilising effect during quiet standing among older adults.","Functional balance, External loads, Grocery bags, Postural stability, Age-related changes",M.W.

"The paper describes an iterative development process used to understand the suitability of different inclusive design evaluation tools applied into design practices. At the end of this process, a tool named Inclusive Design Advisor was developed, combining data related to design features of small appliances with ergonomic task demands, anthropometric data and exclusion data. When auditing a new design the tool examines the exclusion that each design feature can cause, followed by objective recommendations directly related to its features. Interactively, it allows designers or clients to balance design changes with the exclusion caused. It presents the type of information that enables designers and clients to discuss user needs and make more inclusive design decisions.","Ergonomic task demands, Design practice, Inclusive design tool, Design for all, Universal design",Emilene Zitkus and Patrick Langdon and P.

"This investigation examined interactions between the magnitude of external load, movement speed and (a)symmetry of load placement on estimates of in vivo joint loading in the lumbar spine during simulated occupational lifting. Thirty-two participants with manual materials handling experience were included in the study. Three-dimensional motion data, ground reaction forces, and activation of six bilateral trunk muscle groups were captured while participants performed lifts with two loads at two movement speeds and using two load locations. L4-L5 joint compression and shear force-time histories were estimated using an EMG-assisted musculoskeletal model of the lumbar spine. Results from this investigation provide strong evidence that known mechanical low back injury risk factors should not be viewed in isolation. Rather, injury prevention efforts need to consider the complex interactions that exist between external task demands and their combined influence on internal joint loading.","Interaction, Task demands, Joint loads",Chad E.

"Knife sharpness is one of multiple factors involved in musculoskeletal disorders in industrial meat cutting. The aim of this study was to objectively evaluate, in real working situations, how knife sharpness changed over a working day cutting meat, and to analyse the impact of sharpening, steeling and meat-cutting activities on these variations. Twenty-two meat-cutting workers from three different companies participated in the study. The methods included measurements of knife sharpness in relation to real work situations and consideration of the way meat-cutting and sharpening operations were organised. Results showed that the type of meat-cutting activities, the steeling strategy adopted by the worker, including the types of tool used, and the overall organisation of the sharpening task all had a significant influence on how knife sharpness evolved over a 2-h period and over an entire working day. To improve MSD prevention, sharpening and steeling operations should not be considered as independent activities, but taken into account as a continuity of working actions. Appropriate assessment of knife sharpness by meat cutters affects how they organise meat-cutting and sharpening tasks.","Knife sharpness, MSD, Sharpness measurement system, Sharpness evolution, Objective assessment",Adriana Savescu and Aude Cuny-Guerrier and Pascal Wild and Gilles Reno and AgnÃ¨s Aublet-Cuvelier and Laurent Claudon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302570,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.11.008,0003-6870,2018,109--116,68,Applied Ergonomics,Objective assessment of knife sharpness over a working day cutting meat,article,SAVESCU2018109
"Prolonged standing is common in many occupations and has been associated with low back discomfort (LBD). No recent studies have investigated a footrest as an intervention to reduce LBD associated with prolonged standing. This study investigated the effect of a footrest on LBD and sought to determine if LBD changes were accompanied by changes in muscle fatigue and low back end-range posture and movement. Twenty participants stood for two 2-h trials, one with and one without a footrest. LBD, lumbar erector spinae electromyography, upper lumbar (UL) and lower lumbar (LL) angles were measured. A significant increase in LBD occurred in both conditions but the footrest did not significantly decrease LBD. The only significant finding between conditions was that UL lordosis became more similar to usual standing over time with footrest use. These findings suggest that footrest use may not reduce LBD development and that development of LBD with prolonged standing is unlikely to be due to muscle fatigue or end-range posture mechanisms.","Prolonged standing, Low back discomfort, Footrest, Muscle fatigue, Low back postures",Jeremy Yang Lee and Richelle Baker and Pieter Coenen and Leon Straker,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302053,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.09.009,0003-6870,2018,218--224,67,Applied Ergonomics,Use of a footrest to reduce low back discomfort development due to prolonged standing,article,LEE2018218
"This study aimed to assess the physiological consequences of using an upper limb exoskeleton during manual handling task, as muscle activity, upper limb kinematics, postural balance and cardiac cost. Participants performed three tasks (load lifting (LIFT), carrying (WALK) and stacking-unstacking (STACK)) with (EXOS) and without (FREE) an exoskeleton. During LIFT and STACK, the activity of the deltoid anterior muscle was significantly lower for EXOS than for FREE. During LIFT, the activity of the triceps brachii (TB) and tibialis anterior muscles significantly increased for EXO. The TB muscle activity significantly decreased for EXOS during WALK. The cardiac cost tended to increase with the use of the exoskeleton during LIFT, compared to FREE. The upper limb kinematics significantly differed between the EXOS and FREE conditions for all tasks. The benefits of the upper limb exoskeleton to reduce shoulder flexor muscle activity has been demonstrated, while broader physiological consequences have also been evidenced as increased antagonist muscle activity, postural strains, cardiovascular demand, and modified kinematics.","Workload, TMS, EMG",Jean Theurel and Kevin Desbrosses and Terence Roux and Adriana Savescu,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302296,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.10.008,0003-6870,2018,211--217,67,Applied Ergonomics,Physiological consequences of using an upper limb exoskeleton during manual handling tasks,article,THEUREL2018211
"Emergency response organizations need to be resilient to cope with escalating events resulting from dynamic, unexpected, or complex situations. In Brazil, the Firefighter Corps are military hierarchal organizations with a culture based on fixed structures, well defined norms and procedures. These push against innovations which are necessary to be resilient. This research describes how firefighter captains in the 30â??35-year age range managed an emergency response escalation in light of standard operating procedures (SOPs) during a training exercise. The study used ethnographic methods to find and discuss gaps between the instructions and the activities carried out during the exercise, highlighting the differences between work as done (WAD) and work as imagined (WAI), as it was instantiated in the SOP prescriptions. The aim was to produce reflections on WAI and WAD as a way to raise awareness of the need for a cultural change toward resilience in firefighter organizations. This was achieved through firefighter engagement with a comprehensive visualization of the analysis results which afforded easy interaction between the experts, the data, and the researchers.","Emergency response, Simulation exercises, WAI and WAD, Resilience engineering",Paulo Victor R. de Carvalho and Angela W.

"Digital human modeling tools support proactive ergonomics in optimizing work tasks and workplace layouts. Empirical-statistical model based tools are often used to estimate the force exertion capability of the operators. This work is intended to serve as an initial probing into the usability of a musculoskeletal model based software, AnyBody Modeling Systems (AMS), in evaluating the force exertion capability at different points in the workspace and for various exertion directions. As a first step, it focuses on the modeling approach and the accuracy of one-handed isometric strength estimates of AMS. An existing literature database was used to compare the predicted strength at 8 hand locations and in 26 exertion directions, while simulating the empirical postures. The results show a correlation coefficient of 0.7 between the simulated and the experimental strength. AMS emphasizes the biomechanical advantages in strength due to the alignment of force exertion direction with the shoulder. Additionally, some discrepancies have been identified and discussed.","Musculoskeletal modeling, Workplace optimization, Standing exertion",Divyaksh Subhash Chander and Maria Pia Cavatorta,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302211,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.09.015,0003-6870,2018,225--236,67,Applied Ergonomics,Multi-directional one-handed strength assessments using AnyBody Modeling Systems,article,CHANDER2018225
"To advance our understanding about the association between smartphone use and chronic neck-shoulder pain, the objective of this study was to compare spinal kinematics between different text-entry methods in smartphone users with and without chronic neck-shoulder pain. Symptomatic (nÂ =Â 19) and healthy participants (nÂ =Â 18) were recruited and they performed three tasks: texting on a smartphone with one hand, with two hands, and typing on a desktop computer. Three-dimensional kinematics were examined in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions for each task. This study suggests that altered kinematics may be associated with pain since significantly increased angles of cervical right side flexion during smartphone texting and greater postural changes in cervical rotation were found during all text-entry tasks in the symptomatic group. Two-handed texting was associated with increased cervical flexion while one-handed texting was correlated with an asymmetric neck posture, indicating both text-entry methods are not favorable in terms of spinal postures.","Motor control, Neck pain, Repetitive movement",Yan Fei Xie and Grace Szeto and Pascal Madeleine and Sharon Tsang,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302454,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.10.018,0003-6870,2018,160--168,68,Applied Ergonomics,Spinal kinematics during smartphone texting â??

"Whole body vibration (WBV) exposures are often predominant in the fore-aft (x) or lateral (y) axis among off-road agricultural vehicles. However, as the current industry standard seats are designed to reduce mainly vertical (z) axis WBV exposures, they may be less effective in reducing drivers' exposure to multi-axial WBV. Therefore, this laboratory-based study aimed to determine the differences between a single-axial (vertical) and multi-axial (verticalÂ +Â lateral) suspension seat in reducing WBV exposures, head acceleration, self-reported discomfort, and muscle activity (electromyography) of the major muscle of the low back, neck and shoulders. The results showed that the multi-axial suspension seat had significantly lower WBV exposures compared to the single-axial suspension seats (p'Â <Â 0.04). Similarly, the multi-axial suspension seat had lower head acceleration and muscle activity of the neck, shoulder, and low back compared to the single-axial suspension seat; some but not all of the differences were statistically significant. These results indicate that the multi-axial suspension seat may reduce the lateral WBV exposures and associated muscular loading in the neck and low back in agricultural vehicle operators.","Whole body vibration, Off-road vehicles, Agricultural tractors, Electromyography, Seat suspension",Jeong Ho Kim and Jack T.

"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an industrial exoskeleton on muscle activity, perceived musculoskeletal effort, measured and perceived contact pressure at the trunk, thighs and shoulders, and subjective usability for simple sagittal plane lifting and lowering conditions. Twelve male participants lifted and lowered a box of 7.5Â kg and 15Â kg, respectively, from mid-shin height to waist height, five times, both with and without the exoskeleton. The device significantly reduced muscle activity of the Erector Spinae (12%-15%) and Biceps Femoris (5%). Ratings of perceived musculoskeletal effort in the trunk region were significantly less with the device (9.5%-11.4%). The measured contact pressure was highest on the trunk (91.7Â kPa-93.8Â kPa) and least on shoulders (47.6Â kPa-51.7Â kPa), whereas pressure was perceived highest on the thighs (35-44% of Max LPP). Six of the users rated the device usability as acceptable. The exoskeleton reduced musculoskeletal loading on the lower back and assisted with hip extensor torque during lifting and lowering. Contact pressures fell below the Pain Pressure Threshold. Perceived pressure was not exceptionally high, but sufficiently high to cause discomfort if used for long durations.","Exoskeleton, Wearable robotics, Power augmentation",Kirsten Huysamen and Michiel {de Looze} and Tim Bosch and Jesus Ortiz and Stefano Toxiri and Leonard W.

"Wheelchair rugby is a sport that has been gaining popularity with athletes with disabilities. However, as it is relatively new and not played by the masses, market specific sports-wear is not available for this sport, which impacts directly on performance and clothing satisfaction of the athletes. Therefore, the main objective of this research was to identify the problems that wheelchair rugby players face with the sports-wear they use for playing the game. The data was collected using a focus group and a questionnaire with 61 wheelchair rugby players in the United Kingdom. Based on their suggestions, on the team expertise, and on the literature, a set of design recommendations was proposed for the upper body garments (tops), lower body garments (bottoms), and gloves. The results demonstrated that the gloves currently available negatively impact on playersâ?? ability to participate with satisfactory levels of protection and comfort. Moreover, tops and bottoms also present issues, mainly in the fit and ability to regulate the core body temperature. Hence, the recommendations proposed can provide designers with key information on the specific sports-wear requirements and allow them to design and develop products that can satisfy real needs of specific end-users. This paper intends to raise awareness of the needs of sports-wear for those playing wheelchair rugby and promote the inclusivity of athletes with disabilities.","Inclusive design, Sports-wear, Wheelchair rugby",Sara BraganÃ§a and Ignacio Castellucci and Simeon Gill and Pascal Matthias and Miguel Carvalho and Pedro Arezes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.09.005,0003-6870,2018,9--25,67,Applied Ergonomics,Insights on the apparel needs and limitations for athletes with disabilities: The design of wheelchair rugby sports-wear,article,BRAGANCA20189
"Static strength is typically used to standardize occupational tasks in an effort to limit over-exertion injuries; however, workplace tasks are commonly dynamic in nature. The purpose of this investigation was to assess factors influencing isokinetic shoulder strength and to develop predictive equations for isokinetic shoulder flexion and extension strength using isometric strength. Fifteen women performed a set of concentric isokinetic and isometric shoulder flexion and extension maximal exertions across a series of movement planes, angular velocities, and grip types. Data were used to generate two stepwise multiple regression models for predicting isokinetic shoulder flexion and exertion strength across the various exertion parameters. The final regression models explained a high degree of variance in predicting isokinetic shoulder flexion (R2Â =Â 0.59) and extension (R2Â =Â 0.67) with a subset of four and five inputs, respectively. The predictive equations can help establish acceptable force limits for workplace tasks requiring dynamic actions using more easily attainable static forces.","Shoulder, Strength, Workplace design",Alison C.

"Many police organisations incorporate specialist policing roles where incumbents are tasked with providing operational response capabilities above and beyond the general duties policing role. The current research utilised subjective job task analysis methods to identify and characterise the physically demanding, frequently occurring, and operationally important tasks, as well as the dominant fitness component for each task, inherent to specialist policing roles in an Australian policing organisation. This was achieved through engagement with subject matter experts and online survey responses from specialist police incumbents. In total, 11 criterion tasks were identified, which covered a range of physical capacities including muscular strength, muscular endurance, and aerobic power. The most physically demanding tasks included those with an arrest component, requiring high muscular strength and power capacities. Having identified the criterion tasks, three operational scenarios were constructed, which incorporated each of the 11 tasks in different operational contexts. The criterion tasks and composite scenarios will allow practitioners within specialised police units to develop evidence-based strategies, including physical selection procedures and physical training programs, specific to the demands of their work.","Job task analysis, Police, Physical employment tests, Criterion tasks",Aaron Silk and Robbie Savage and Brianna Larsen and Brad Aisbett,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017302612,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.11.012,0003-6870,2018,197--203,68,Applied Ergonomics,Identifying and characterising the physical demands for an Australian specialist policing unit,article,SILK2018197

"Dissatisfaction with work boot design is common in the mining industry. Many underground coal miners believe their work boots contribute to the high incidence of lower limb injuries they experience. Despite this, the most recent research to examine underground coal mining work boot satisfaction was conducted over a decade ago. This present study aimed to address this gap in the literature by assessing current mining work boot satisfaction in relation to the work-related requirements for underground coal mining. 358 underground coal miners (355 men; mean ageÂ =Â 39.1Â Â±Â 10.7 years) completed a 54-question survey regarding their job details, work footwear habits, foot problems, lower limb and lower back pain history, and work footwear fit and comfort. Results revealed that underground coal miners were not satisfied with their current mining work boots. This was evident in the high incidence of reported foot problems (55.3%), lower back pain (44.5%), knee pain (21.5%), ankle pain (24.9%) and foot pain (42.3%). Over half of the underground coal miners surveyed believed their work boots contributed to their lower limb pain and reported their work boots were uncomfortable. Different working roles and environments resulted in differences in the incidence of foot problems, lower limb pain and comfort scores, confirming that one boot design cannot meetÂ all the work-related requirements of underground coal mining. Further research examining the interaction of a variety of boot designs across the different underground surfaces and the different tasks miners perform is paramount to identify key boot design features that affect the way underground coal miners perform. Enhanced work boot design could improve worker comfort and productivity by reducing the high rates of reported foot problems and pain amongst underground coal miners.","Boots, Mining, Pain",Jessica A.

"Trust in automation is a key determinant for the adoption of automated systems and their appropriate use. Therefore, it constitutes an essential research area for the introduction of automated vehicles to road traffic. In this study, we investigated the influence of trust promoting (Trust promoted group) and trust lowering (Trust lowered group) introductory information on reported trust, reliance behavior and take-over performance. Forty participants encountered three situations in a 17-min highway drive in a conditionally automated vehicle (SAE Level 3). Situation 1 and Situation 3 were non-critical situations where a take-over was optional. Situation 2 represented a critical situation where a take-over was necessary to avoid a collision. A non-driving-related task (NDRT) was presented between the situations to record the allocation of visual attention. Participants reporting a higher trust level spent less time looking at the road or instrument cluster and more time looking at the NDRT. The manipulation of introductory information resulted in medium differences in reported trust and influenced participants' reliance behavior. Participants of the Trust promoted group looked less at the road or instrument cluster and more at the NDRT. The odds of participants of the Trust promoted group to overrule the automated driving system in the non-critical situations were 3.65 times (Situation 1) to 5 times (Situation 3) higher. In Situation 2, the Trust promoted group's mean take-over time was extended by 1154Â ms and the mean minimum time-to-collision was 933Â ms shorter. Six participants from the Trust promoted group compared to no participant of the Trust lowered group collided with the obstacle. The results demonstrate that the individual trust level influences how much drivers monitor the environment while performing an NDRT. Introductory information influences this trust level, reliance on an automated driving system, and if a critical take-over situation can be successfully solved.","Automated driving, Trust in automation, Reliance",Moritz KÃ¶rber and Eva Baseler and Klaus Bengler,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017301606,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.07.006,0003-6870,2018,18--31,66,Applied Ergonomics,Introduction matters: Manipulating trust in automation and reliance in automated driving,article,KORBER201818
"Like most work systems, the domain of adventure activities has seen a series of serious incidents and subsequent calls to improve regulation. Safety regulation systems aim to promote safety and reduce accidents. However, there is scant evidence they have led to improved safety outcomes. In fact there is some evidence that the poor integration of regulatory system components has led to adverse safety outcomes in some contexts. Despite this, there is an absence of methods for evaluating regulatory and compliance systems. This article argues that sociotechnical systems theory and methods provide a suitable framework for evaluating regulatory systems. This is demonstrated through an analysis of a recently introduced set of adventure activity regulations. Work Domain Analysis (WDA) was used to describe the regulatory system in terms of its functional purposes, values and priority measures, purpose-related functions, object-related processes and cognitive objects. This allowed judgement to be made on the nature of the new regulatory system and on the constraints that may impact its efficacy following implementation. Importantly, the analysis suggests that the new system's functional purpose of ensuring safe activities is not fully supported in terms of the functions and objects available to fulfil them. Potential improvements to the design of the system are discussed along with the implications for regulatory system design and evaluation across the safety critical domains generally.","Adventure activities, Adventure education, Cognitive work analysis, Outdoor activities, Outdoor education, Outdoor recreation, Regulation, Regulatory systems, Sociotechnical systems, Work Domain Analysis",Tony Carden and Natassia Goode and Gemma J.M.

"Examinations of interruptions in healthcare often focus on a single clinical discipline, and solutions are targeted accordingly. This approach does not take into account the inter-disciplinary dependencies and other sociotechnical aspects that make up the healthcare work system, and suggested solutions may not meet the needs of all stakeholders. In this article a sociotechnical systems perspective is used to uncover the interdependencies between 16 unique work roles that result in interruptions in an intensive care unit (ICU). By applying social network analysis techniques to data collected using the Dual Perspectives Method, we identified targeted systems-based interventions that may reduce unnecessary interruptions while avoiding unintended consequences that impose additional burden on ICU staff. The rich insights gained into the interruptive communication patterns in the ICU work system stand in contrast to findings that would have otherwise been obtained by focusing only on a single clinical discipline or a single perspective.","Interruptions, Social network analysis, Sociotechnical systems",Tara McCurdie and Penelope Sanderson and Leanne M.

"The purpose of this study was to develop a methodology that extends safety climate beyond an overall score by using the framework of macroergonomics to examine the entire system in a more comprehensive manner. The study is discussed in two papers: one paper describes the study methodology in detail (Murphy, Robertson, Huang, Jeffries, & Dainoff, in press), and the current paper describes the results of the study. Multiple methods were combined to create a systems approach, and those methods include the critical incident technique, contextual inquiries with functional role diagrams, and affinity mapping. Key informants in the trucking industry identified 19 themes that affect safety. The themes ranged from balancing work and family/personal time, the company's policy vs. practice, respecting the job of the driver, and active listening and meaningful feedback. The most prominent themes were related to the workers and their activities; the internal environment, including psychosocial job design elements; and organizational design. Such information can be used to design interventions to change the safety climate of an organization in order to reduce negative safety outcomes.","Macroergonomics, Safety climate, Sociotechnical systems theory",Lauren A.

"A timely and accurate acquisition of the information provided by variable message signs (VMS) can be crucial while driving. In the current study, we assess the difficulties of adults with dyslexia acquiring the information shown in VMS and provide evidence to discuss the controversial use of pictograms as potential countermeasures. Twenty-two adults with dyslexia and 22 matched controls completed a simulated driving session. The legibility of 12 VMS was assessed, including six text messages (e.g. â??ACCIDENTâ?) and six single pictograms (e.g. the icon for â??accident aheadâ?). On average, participants with dyslexia started reading text messages when they were closer to the VMS. In addition, while approaching text VMS, they dedicated more gazes and manifested worse control of speed. Regarding pictogram VMS, we observed no differences in response distance, accuracy, response duration, or number of gazes. To sum up, the evidence provided reveals that adults with dyslexia, despite potential compensation effects, may still find difficulties reading text messages in VMS (shorter legibility distances, longer reading times, and increased cognitive effort), whereas we found no such differences in the recognition of pictograms (only some difficulties keeping a steady speed). Research on inclusive measures to improve reading in low-skilled or dyslexic drivers must be encouraged.","Traffic sign legibility, Dyslexia, Cognitive demands, Variable message signs, Pictograms, Driver simulator",J.

"The revolution of technologically advanced vehicles with a high level of automation involves a profound transformation. The focus of most research in this area has been on the use of travel time for different use cases. Sleeping is one of the most time-consuming activities in everyone's life; therefore, this has been described as one of the most desired use cases for fully automated vehicles. In order to identify the best conditions to allow sleep and improve sleep quality while travelling in such vehicles, two studies were performed: a sleep study and a pressure distribution study, the results of which are included in this document. The focus of both studies was on two seat positions: reclined (60Â° backrest recline) and flat (87Â° backrest recline). In the sleep study, forty participants had the opportunity to sleep during a 90-min drive in order to evaluate long-term comfort and subjective sleep quantity and quality. Although both positions resulted in generally similar results in terms of sleep and comfort, some significant differences were identified. Karolinska Sleepiness Scale results showed that sleepiness increased in the reclined position, whereas it decreased in the flat position. Moreover, the self-reported parameter Wake After Sleep Onset was higher in the reclined position. In the pressure distribution study, it was possible to identify specific seat prototype limitations indicating inadequate support, which was related to discomfort detected during the sleep study. As a conclusion, the comparison between the reclined and flat positions showed indications that, in moving fully automated vehicles, the flat seat position is the most comfortable and effective for sleeping.","Comfort, Sleep, Ergonomics",Irene Caballero-Bruno and Thomas Wohllebe and Daniel TÃ¶pfer and Pedro M.

"This study aimed at understanding animal research technicians (ART) work activity to identify difficulties encountered by workers and their determinants which may increase musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) risks. The methods for the work activity analysis combined interviews, observations, events and operations chronicles as well as inclinometry. From the work activity analysis of the three main tasks (changing mouse cages, preparation of water bottles and unloading dirty material), difficulties such as awkward postures, heavy load handling, repetitiveness, high workload, supplementary tasks, interruptions and difficult social interactions emerged. The work activity analysis further allowed the identification of determinants of these difficulties. Some are related to the physical, organizational or social work environment, and others to the interdependence between these determinants. Such an improved understanding of ART work activity will lead to solutions best suited for MSDs prevention in this understudied setting.","Musculoskeletal disorders, Work activity analysis, Animal research technicians",R.

"Society relies upon informal (family, friend) caregivers to provide much of the care to the estimated 43.8 million individuals living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias globally. Caregivers rarely receive sufficient training, resources, or support to meet the demands associated with dementia care, which is often associated with increased risk of suboptimal outcomes. Human factors and ergonomics (HFE) can address the call for new approaches to better understand caregiving and support caregiver performance through systematic attention to and design of systems that support the work of caregiversâ?? their care work. Thus, our objective was to perform a work system analysis of care work. We conducted a qualitative study using a Critical Incident Technique interviewing approach and Grounded Dimensional Analysis analytic procedures. Our findings introduce a new conceptual framework for understanding the care work system of dementia caregivers and suggest that care work is influenced by interactions among distinct caregiver goals, the task demands of the care needs of the person with dementia, daily life needs of the caregiver and family, and contextual factors that shape caregivers' perceptions surrounding care. The initial work system model produced by this study provides a foundation from which future work can further elucidate the care work system, determine how the care work system intersects and coordinates with other work systems such as the patient work system, and design systems that address caregivers' individual caregiving context.","Patient work, Informal caregiving, Patient ergonomics, Work system, Alzheimer's disease, Dementia",Nicole E.

"Sedentary behavior has increased steadily over prior decades, primarily due to increased computer use at work and at home. The total sedentary time per day has been associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases; increased sitting time at work has been associated with musculoskeletal discomfort particularly in the low back. Office workers spend many hours sitting, thus efforts to increase movement through changes of posture (sit to stand) or moving while sitting have been proposed as ways to mitigate the negative effects of prolonged sitting. Yet, few studies have investigated differences in the movement patterns of office workers while sitting performing their actual work. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize movement patterns during a prolonged sitting bout and to determine their association with musculoskeletal pain. Twenty-eight office workers participated in this field study that used a pressure sensitive mat to quantify seat pan pressure (4 regions) and trunk sway parameters over a 2-hour bout of computer work. Data were stratified by breakers who stood up at least once within the 2-hour test and prolongers who remained sitting throughout the test. Overall, there was a decreasing trend in trunk sway parameters (mean COP position, sway path, sway area, sway velocity, maximum displacement, and in-chair movements) over time (pÂ <Â 0.05), with significant changes in sitting strategies. There were significant differences in trunk sway parameters and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort between breakers and prolongers with breakers having more consistent movement while sitting over the prolonged sitting bout (pÂ <Â 0.05) and lower discomfort ratings. This may indicate that interrupting prolonged bouts of sitting with short periods of standing can maintain sitting movement patterns and reduce the development of musculoskeletal discomfort. Trunk sway monitoring and promoting periodic standing may be useful tools for maintaining in chair movements that may reduce or prevent the onset of musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting.","Sitting posture, Trunk postural sway, Prolonged sitting, In-chair-movements",Federico Arippa and Athena Nguyen and Massimiliano Pau and Carisa Harris-Adamson,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000461,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103723,0003-6870,2022,103723,102,Applied Ergonomics,Postural strategies among office workers during a prolonged sitting bout,article,ARIPPA2022103723
"Multiple time series graphs are used prevalently in representing business and research data, but the use of color properties to visualize them to enhance comprehension is limited. This study explored the effect of hue and lightness in representing 4-time series data in relation to response time (RT) and accuracy. Two types of palettes were developed for each experiment: monochrome and multi-hue. The three sets of monochrome palettes created were red, green, and blue, while four equidistant hues in the color wheel were used in the multi-hue palette: red, blue, green, and purple. A total of forty people participated in the two experiments. Participants performed two tasks for both experiments: maximum and discrimination tasks. The monochrome experiment showed the primacy of green in terms of RT and accuracy in the discrimination task. RT and accuracy were significantly affected by lightness in the multi-hue experiment. For both tasks, RT was longer for 20% lightness and lowest at 60% lightness. Accuracy results were also consistent with RT. In the discrimination task, participants made more errors in 20% lightness and the highest accuracy for 60% and 80%.","Color, Data and knowledge visualization, Graphics recognition and interpretation, Time series analysis",Rosemary R.

"Industrial settings will be characterized by far-reaching production automation brought about by advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, human assembly workers will need to adapt quickly to new and more complex assembly procedures, which are most likely to increase cognitive workload, or potentially induce overload. Measurement and optimization protocols need to be developed in order to be able to monitor workersâ?? cognitive load. Previous studies have used electroencephalographic (EEG, measuring brain activity) and electrooculographic (EOG, measuring eye movements) signals, using basic computer-based static tasks and without creating an experience of overload. In this study, EEG and EOG data was collected of 46 participants performing an ecologically valid assembly task while inducing three levels of cognitive load (low, high and overload). The lower individual alpha frequency (IAF) was identified as a promising marker for discriminating between different levels of cognitive load and overload.","Industrial setting, Assembly task, Cognitive workload, Cognitive ergonomics, Overload, EEG, EOG",Jessica Morton and Aleksandra Zheleva and Bram B. {Van Acker} and Wouter Durnez and Pieter Vanneste and Charlotte Larmuseau and Jonas {De Bruyne} and Annelies Raes and Frederik Cornillie and Jelle Saldien and Lieven {De Marez} and Klaas Bombeke,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000862,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103763,0003-6870,2022,103763,102,Applied Ergonomics,"Danger, high voltage!

"The relationship between sleep and health and wellbeing is receiving increasing attention in our society, following decades of research that has demonstrated the impact of insufficient sleep on performance and health. Fatigue has been identified as a factor in 21% of high-risk incidents in the GB rail industry, and insufficient sleep and long periods of being awake are known to be two key contributors to fatigue. This paper presents evidence from a recent survey conducted in the GB rail industry, which enabled the sleep and wakefulness of railway workers to be quantified. There were 7807 responses to the survey, which represents a very large sample. Responses were primarily collected online, though paper copies were made available in some organisations. Respondents reported sleeping less when working nights, more when working days, and the most on days off, which suggests a feast-and-famine pattern of sleep. 41% were getting 6Â h of sleep or less when working days, compared to 63% when working nights. Getting 6Â h or less of sleep was associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Although it is accepted that individualsâ?? sleep requirements vary, the patterns that shift workers reported in this survey suggest that many are not achieving the amount of sleep they need. The findings of the survey presented in this paper highlight that there is work to be done to understand and address the causes of insufficient sleep in railway workers.","Fatigue risk management, Sleep, Shiftwork, Railway",Dan Basacik and Anisha Tailor,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000345,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103711,0003-6870,2022,103711,102,Applied Ergonomics,A feast-and-famine pattern of sleep: Do railway staff get the sleep they need?,article,BASACIK2022103711

"The psychological refractory period (PRP) effect denotes the finding that shortening the temporal interval between two tasks leads to increased reaction time in the second task. Earlier work in driving simulators confirmed the emergence of a PRP effect even if the second task (T2) was ecologically relevant, such as in a car-braking task. Here we evaluate the PRP effect if the first task (T1) is ecologically relevant as well. In a driving simulator, participants had to warn pedestrians against crossing the street (T1), and had to brake when the lead car braked (T2). As the temporal interval between tasks decreased, reaction time in T2 increased, confirming once more the emergence of a PRP effect. The PRP effect in our study was larger than in previous studies where T1 was artificial rather than ecologically relevant. This suggests that an ecologically relevant T1 is processed more elaborately, resulting in stronger interference with T2.","Ecological validity, Simulated car driving, Dual-task interference",Konstantin Wechsler and Otmar Bock and Torsten Schubert and Iring Koch,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702200045X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103722,0003-6870,2022,103722,102,Applied Ergonomics,"Dual-task interference in simulated car driving: The psychological refractory period effect when not only the second, but also the first task is ecologically relevant",article,WECHSLER2022103722
"Inattentiveness of road users on approach to passive railway crossings represents a major threat to level crossing safety. An auxiliary strobe light system installed on trains in addition to existing headlights may help address this issue by providing an ergonomic way of attracting human attention to the level crossing and to the train. The objective of this paper was to investigate the ergonomics and safety potential of auxiliary strobe light systems. A system was implemented on a real railway vehicle and in the virtual environment of a driving simulator. Acceptance of the system, including its usefulness and perceived benefits and drawbacks, as well as its objective effectiveness, were evaluated using questionnaires, behavioural measures, and eye tracking. The safety potential of the system was evaluated with respect to fatal level crossing accidents. The auxiliary strobe lights were preferred over normal lights and were rated as useful, reducing driving speeds, increasing visual scanning at level crossings, and thus aiding detection of a train. The system has the potential to prevent 6â??30% of level crossing accidents in Europe. The results suggest that it might be worthwhile to test auxiliary strobe lights in a larger scale real-world experiment. Especially on railway lines with a high number of passive level crossings, this system can be expected to increase safety by supporting timely detection by road users and preventing accidents caused by inattentiveness.","Train visibility, Lights, Level crossing, Safety",Anne Silla and Annika Dressler and Esko Lehtonen and Ari Virtanen and Johannes MesimÃ¤ki and Jan Grippenkoven,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000904,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103767,0003-6870,2022,103767,103,Applied Ergonomics,Potential of auxiliary strobe lights on train locomotives to improve level crossing safety,article,SILLA2022103767
"Visuospatial attention during walking has been associated with pedestrian safety and fall risks. However, visuospatial attention measures during walking remained under-explored.

"Human factors research can play an important role in the successful design of infrastructure to support future mobility. Through engaging users and stakeholders early in the design process we can gain insights before the physical environments are built. This paper presents data from a truly novel application of Virtual Reality (VR), where user experience and wayfinding were evaluated within an emerging future transport infrastructure to support urban air mobility (UAM) â?? the urban airport (aka vertiports). Urban airports are located in city centres where drones or â??flying carsâ?? would land and take off from. Previous quantitative studies have investigated passenger experience in traditional airports using field observation and surveys, but this paper is the first to present qualitative research on user experience in this emerging mobility infrastructure using an immersive VR environment. Twenty participants completed a series of six scenarios aimed at understanding customer â??excitersâ?? and â??pain pointsâ?? within an urban airport. Results and recommendations from this empirical research will help inform the design of all future mobility infrastructure solutions, through improving user experience before the infrastructure is physically deployed.

"Sensorimotor performance is known to deteriorate during spaceflight. Prior research for instance documented that targeted arm motions are performed slower and less precise in microgravity conditions. This article describes an experiment on aiming performance during different stages of a space mission. Moreover, the influence of different haptic settings of the human-machine interface (HMI) was explored. Two separate studies are presented in which the same aiming tasks were performed with a force feedback joystick: 1) A terrestrial study (NÂ =Â 20) to explore time and haptic setting effects and 2) a space experiment (NÂ =Â 3) with a pre-mission session, three mission sessions on board the ISS (2, 4, and 6 weeks in space), and a post-mission session. Results showed that sensorimotor performance was mainly affected in the initial phase of exposure to microgravity and this effect was moderated by astronautsâ?? sensorimotor skills. Providing low stiffness at the HMI, however, proved to be an effective measure to maintain aiming precision in microgravity.","Microgravity, Sensorimotor performance, Haptic devices, Force feedback",Bernhard M.

"In augmented reality (AR), virtual information is optically combined with the physical environment. In the most frequently used combination technique, optical settings in AR depart from the settings in natural viewing. Depending on the combination of viewing distances of the virtual task and its physical background, this deviation may lower visual performance and cause visual disturbance symptoms. The so-called vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC) has been identified as a cause for the visual disturbance symptoms in AR. In this study, for various distance combinations, the performance and symptoms when performing a search task displayed in a see-through head-mounted display (AR HMD, HoloLens 1st generation, Microsoft, USA) was investigated. The search task was displayed at a virtual distance of either 200Â cm or 30Â cm, and the real background was viewed either at a distance of 200Â cm or 30Â cm. Three combinations of viewing distances for the background and the virtual task were studied: 200 cm/200Â cm, 200 cm/30Â cm, and 30 cm/30Â cm. Results revealed that both performance and visual disturbance symptoms depend on the combination of the viewing distances of the physical background and the virtual task. When the physical background was viewed at a distance of 200Â cm, younger participants showed a significantly better search performance and reported stronger symptoms compared with older participants, no matter whether the virtual task was performed at 30Â cm or at 200Â cm. However, with the physical background at a distance of 30Â cm, the performance of the younger group dropped to the level of the performance of the older group, and younger participants tended to report a stronger increase in visual disturbance symptoms compared with the older participants. From the AR HMD technology used in this study, it can be concluded that a near viewing distance of the virtual task does not cause a negative impact on performance and visual disturbance symptoms, provided any physical background seen through the AR HMD is not at a near viewing distance. The findings indicate that the VAC, which persists in augmented and virtual reality, depends, in addition to the physical component evaluating the optical distance, on a cognitive component evaluating the perceived distance. AR settings should therefore also be evaluated in terms of possible effects on perceived distance.","Augmented reality, Accommodation-vergence conflict, Viewing distance, Near work",Ying-Yin Huang and Marino Menozzi,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000692,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103746,0003-6870,2022,103746,102,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of viewing distance and age on the performance and symptoms in a visual search task in augmented reality,article,HUANG2022103746

A laboratory study was conducted with four levels of mental workload, ranging from none to high and during sitting and stepping activities. When sitting, a difference in the heart rate and motion data from the smartwatch was only found between no mental workload and any mental workload task. For the stepping condition, differences were found for the movement data.

Participants were 1.12 times more likely to correctly identify medications from farther away (pÂ <Â 0.001, AORÂ =Â 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.22) with icons. When icons were present, participants were 2.16 times more likely to be more confident in their identifications (pÂ <Â 0.001, AORÂ =Â 2.16, 95%CI: 1.80, 2.57). Carefully designed icons may offer an additional method for identifying medications, and thus reducing medication administration errors.","Human factors, Icons, Medication errors, Medication labeling",Connor Lusk and Ken Catchpole and David M.

"Psychological flow is highly pleasurable, time-limited form of engagement in a task which has been shown to produce benefits in the workplace. Flow has historically been studied in the context of the interaction between the task and the performer. However, in work settings such as an office, many other factors may contribute to or hinder the achievement of flow. This present study broadens the research on flow to test the extent to which seating comfort while executing a challenging task influences an individual's ability to achieve flow. Fifty-four participants in this study were randomly assigned to one of two seat types and given a set of tasks to perform via a computer simulation. Seat comfort, coupled with participants' perceptions of their ability to concentrate on the simulation's set of tasks, was found to predict participants' flow experiences. Implications and future directions are discussed.","Psychological flow, Comfort, Concentration, Causal analysis, Scale comparison",Steven R. Clapp and Pamela R.

"Smartphone hard key locations need to be ergonomically determined to improve grip stability and operational efficiency for users' convenience. The present study proposed an ergonomic design process that determines smartphone hard key locations by statistically analyzing the preferred hard key control areas of users with various hand sizes based on usersâ?? preferred grip postures and hard key control areas. The proposed design process analyzes the characteristics of product design, user, task, and use context, the types of preferred grip posture, the preference distribution of grip posture, and the preference distribution of hard-key area, and then recommends the locations of hard keys by considering the preference distribution of hard-key area and design constraints. The proposed design process was applied to a smartphone with a 5-inch screen, resulting in 77â??96Â mm from the bottom of the device for a volume key to 20Â mm on the left side and 88â??97Â mm for a power key to 10Â mm on the right side. The proposed design process for the determination of smartphone hard-key locations would be of use to determine the locations of various portable product interfaces.","martphone, Hard-key location, Physical user interface, Grip posture, Preference distribution",Younggeun Choi and Xiaopeng Yang and Jangwoon Park and Hayoung Jung and Wonsup Lee and Heecheon You,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001794,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103532,0003-6870,2021,103532,97,Applied Ergonomics,Development of an ergonomic design process for smartphone hard key locations,article,CHOI2021103532
"Light/dark cycles play an essential role in people's performance, mood and daily rhythm. This study aimed to evaluate an early prototype of a personalised home lighting system including body-worn loggers. A convenience sample (NÂ =Â 28) wore the devices for 23Â h in the field and were given a demonstration of the lighting system components. Participants reported on questionnaires their acceptance of the lighting system and experience of physical comfort and visual appearance of the body-worn loggers. Semi-structured interviews were also held. In a hierarchical linear regression, physical comfort of the loggers explained 35.8% of the variance of â??the behavioural intention to use the system in the futureâ??, and â??performance expectancyâ?? explained 50.6%. The interview data helped understand the reasons for the physical and psychological discomfort of wearing the devices.

"Bus controllers are an essential part of the London bus network. Although the bus driver is the individual directly in control of the vehicle, inputs from both the controller and driver influence operations. Currently, little research has focused on the dynamic between these parties, and how it works in the day-to-day operation of a bus. In the current study, data was collected across focus groups with controllers to understand the controller-driver relationship from the controller perspective. The objectives of the research were to: investigate interactions and working relationships between bus controllers and drivers in London and to explore the effect of controller/driver relationships on workload, stress and fatigue. It is clear that the working relationship between controllers and drivers is a challenging one, with both parties often misunderstanding the role of the other. This is made worse by the nature of communication via radio including poor quality audio leading to difficult interactions. All of the participating controllers expressed being overloaded with work, leading to feelings of stress and fatigue, with shift work and irregular hours being discussed as a cause of controller fatigue. Any steps taken to improve the difficult working relationship between drivers and controllers can be seen as beneficial because they could improve efficiency, worker wellbeing, and possibly safety.","Fatigue, Sleepiness, Shift work, Bus drivers, Network iBus controllers, Focus groups, Working relationships",Sally Maynard and Karl A.

"Everyday we consume massive amounts of visual information on mobile devices like smartphones. However, are there consequences for viewing information on these devices? In 2 experiments, participants viewed several target objects on two differently sized virtual smartphone displays, and then made a judgment of the size of each target item. Results from both experiments confirm that smartphone display size does impact user perceptions of size, such that larger displays cause users to significantly underestimate the size of objects. This effect held when target items were presented alone, or concurrently with a non-target referent. This is the first study to confirm such an effect and suggests that the size of a smartphone display can negatively influence the accuracy of usersâ?? visual perception. Thus, beyond aesthetics or cost, it must be realized that the choice of device might have additional perceptual consequences for consumers.","Smartphones, Display size, Visual perception",Christopher A.

"Telemedicine implementation in ambulances can reduce time to treatment for stroke patients, which is important as â??time is brainâ? for these patients. Limited research has explored the demands placed on acute stroke caregivers in a telemedicine-integrated ambulance system. This study investigates the impact of telemedicine on workload, teamwork, workflow, and communication of geographically distributed caregivers delivering stroke care in ambulance-based telemedicine and usability of the system. Simulated stroke sessions were conducted with 27 caregivers, who subsequently completed a survey measuring workload, usability, and teamwork. Follow-up interviews with each caregiver ascertained how telemedicine affected workflow and demands which were analyzed for barriers and facilitators to using telemedicine. Caregivers experienced moderate workload and rated team effectiveness and usability high. Barriers included frustration with equipment and with the training of caregivers increasing demands, the loss of personal connection of the neurologists with the patients, and physical constraints in the ambulance. Facilitators were more common with live visual communication increasing teamwork and efficiency, the ease of access to neurologist, increased flexibility, and high overall satisfaction and usability. Future research should focus on eliminating these barriers and supporting the distributed cognition of caregivers.","Telemedicine, Qualitative interviews, Stroke caregiving, Teamwork",Hunter Rogers and Kapil Chalil Madathil and Anjali Joseph and Christine Holmstedt and Suparna Qanungo and Nathan McNeese and Tara Morris and Richard J.

"An important question in the development of automated vehicles (AVs) is which driving style AVs should adopt and how other road users perceive them. The current study aimed to determine which AV behaviours contribute to pedestrians' judgements as to whether the vehicle is driving manually or automatically as well as judgements of likeability. We tested five target trajectories of an AV in curves: playback manual driving, two stereotypical automated driving conditions (road centre tendency, lane centre tendency), and two stereotypical manual driving conditions, which slowed down for curves and cut curves. In addition, four braking patterns for approaching a zebra crossing were tested: manual braking, stereotypical automated driving (fixed deceleration), and two variations of stereotypical manual driving (sudden stop, crawling forward). The AV was observed by 24 participants standing on the curb of the road in groups. After each passing of the AV, participants rated whether the car was driven manually or automatically, and the degree to which they liked the AV's behaviour. Results showed that the playback manual trajectory was considered more manual than the other trajectory conditions. The stereotype automated â??road centre tendencyâ?? and â??lane centre tendencyâ?? trajectories received similar likeability ratings as the playback manual driving. An analysis of written comments showed that curve cutting was a reason to believe the car is driving manually, whereas driving at a constant speed or in the centre was associated with automated driving. The sudden stop was the least likeable way to decelerate, but there was no consensus on whether this behaviour was manual or automated. It is concluded that AVs do not have to drive like a human in order to be liked.","Human-like driving, Manual driving, Automated driving, Trajectory, Deceleration, Pedestrians",Pavlo Bazilinskyy and Tsuyoshi Sakuma and Joost {de Winter},https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000752,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103428,0003-6870,2021,103428,95,Applied Ergonomics,What driving style makes pedestrians think a passing vehicle is driving automatically?,article,BAZILINSKYY2021103428
"Falls during stair descent are dangerous and costly. Contrasting tread edge highlighters improve measures of stair safety, however the necessary contrast level of these interventions has not been investigated. Thirteen older adults (67.7Â Â±Â 5.5 years) completed stair descent trials under normal (300lx) and low (30lx) lighting conditions, blurred and normal vision, and four different contrast levels (0%, 30%, 50%, 70%) between the tread edge highlighter and the neighbouring tread surface. Cadence and heel clearance decreased for 0% contrast compared to 50% and 70% contrast conditions, but contrast had no effect on foot overhang. Blurred vision was observed to be a greater factor influencing biomechanical measures of fall risk than low ambient lighting. Results suggest higher contrast highlighters improve measures of safety, even more so during simulated vision impairment, and that at least 50% contrast difference provides adequate visual information for safer stair ambulation.","Fall prevention, Contrast, Visual impairment, Stair descent, Built environment",Marko Bjelica and Iris C.

"A new technique for the assessment of Team Situation Awareness (TSA) accuracy based upon post task Critical Decision Method structured interviews was developed and tested using 39 combat-ready F/A-18 pilots. Pilots undertook a number of simulated air combat scenarios, flying in flights of four aircraft against a formation of enemy aircraft. Results showed a strong curvilinear relationship where high TSA accuracy resulted in higher performance in some areas of air combat, measured with friendly losses and kills. There were diminishing returns in performance as TSA accuracy increased. This may explain why previous studies on air combat have found relatively weak relationships between situation awareness and performance where the relationship has been assumed to be linear.","Critical decision method, Performance, Team situation awareness",Heikki Mansikka and Kai Virtanen and Ville Uggeldahl and Don Harris,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001204,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103473,0003-6870,2021,103473,96,Applied Ergonomics,Team situation awareness accuracy measurement technique for simulated air combat - Curvilinear relationship between awareness and performance,article,MANSIKKA2021103473
"Hazard perception assessment may benefit from VR-presentation by removing field-of-view restrictions imposed by single-screen tests. One concern is whether VR-induced â??cybersicknessâ?? will offset any benefits. Self-reported cybersickness ratings were recorded from 77 participants viewing two variants of a 360-degree hazard test: hazard perception and hazard prediction. The latter was hypothesised to be particularly susceptible as clips abruptly cut to a probe question at hazard onset. Such sudden occlusions are thought to increase cybersickness. Overall cybersickness levels were low, with only four participants excluded for above-threshold sickness ratings. The remaining participants showed unexpectedly lower symptoms for the hazard prediction test and rated this test format as more comfortable and engaging. These findings mitigate concerns over the use of 360-degree videos in formative hazard assessments, even when clips involve sudden occlusions. Nonetheless, removal of any participants due to cybersickness raises problems for using VR for formal assessments of hazard perception skill.","Virtual reality, Cybersickness, Hazard perception, Hazard prediction",Thomas Goodge and Victoria Kroll and Mike Vernon and Petya Ventsislavova and David Crundall,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001964,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103549,0003-6870,2021,103549,97,Applied Ergonomics,A comparison of cybersickness symptoms across 360-degree hazard perception and hazard prediction tests for drivers,article,GOODGE2021103549
"This study aims to evaluate the effect of workstation type on the neural and vascular networks of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) underlying the cognitive activity involved during mental stress. Workstation design has been reported to affect the physical and mental health of employees. However, while the functional effects of ergonomic workstations have been documented, there is little research on the influence of workstation design on the executive function of the brain. In this study, 23 healthy volunteers in ergonomic and non-ergonomic workstations completed the Montreal imaging stress task, while their brain activity was recorded using the synchronized measurement of electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The results revealed desynchronization in alpha rhythms and oxygenated hemoglobin, as well as decreased functional connectivity in the PFC networks at the non-ergonomic workstations. Additionally, a significant increase in salivary alpha-amylase activity was observed in all participants at the non-ergonomic workstations, confirming the presence of induced stress. These findings suggest that workstation design can significantly impact cognitive functioning and human capabilities at work. Therefore, the use of functional neuroimaging in workplace design can provide critical information on the causes of workplace-related stress.","EEG, Ergonomic, fNIRS, Oxygenated hemoglobin, Prefrontal cortex",Emad Alyan and Naufal M.

"Care transitions that occur across healthcare system boundaries represent a unique challenge for maintaining high quality care and patient safety, as these systems are typically not aligned to perform the care transition process. We explored healthcare professionals' mental models of older adultsâ?? transitions between the emergency department (ED) and skilled nursing facility (SNF). We conducted a thematic analysis of interviews with ED and SNF healthcare professionals and identified three themes: 1) ED and SNF healthcare professionals had misaligned mental models regarding communication processes and tools used during care transitions, 2) ED and SNF healthcare professionals had misaligned mental models regarding healthcare system capability, and 3) Misalignments led to individual and organizational consequences. Overall, we found that SNF and ED healthcare professionals are part of the same process but have different perceptions of the process. Future work must take steps to redesign and realign these distinct work systems such that those involved conceptualize themselves as part of a joint process.","Macroergonomics, Care transitions, Older adults, Mental models, Emergency department, Skilled nursing facility",Nicole E.

Aviation places significant demands on pilots' perceptual and attentional capacities. The avoidance of other objects both on the ground and in the air is critical to safe flight. Research on automobile driving has revealed the occurrence of â??inattentional blindnessâ?? (IB) whereby objects clearly located within the visual field may not detected when drivers are concurrently engaged in another attention capturing task such as a cellphone conversation. Almost no comparable research has been conducted within the aviation domain despite the significance of both ground-based and mid-air collisions. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of diverting attentional resources away from the primary task of safely flying a simulated light aircraft from takeoff to cruising. Flight naÃ¯ve students were trained to proficiency in a flight-simulator and flew two simulated flights with and without a competing attentional task. Detection of a variety of objects placed in the background was measured. The results showed that when distracted by an engaging cellphone conversation novice pilots failed to detect many of the objects located within the visual scene. Recognition accuracy was greater when pilots' attention was not diverted elsewhere. There was a reduction in time spent looking at some key flight instruments but not on others. Inattentional blindness poses significant flight safety risks and further research into both the stimulus and perceiver characteristics that promote or reduce inattentional blindness would be of significant benefit to aviation safety.,"Aviation safety, Attention, Distraction, Simulation, Eye-tracking",Alaska White and David O'Hare,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002258,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103578,0003-6870,2022,103578,98,Applied Ergonomics,In plane sight: Inattentional blindness affects visual detection of external targets in simulated flight,article,WHITE2022103578
"The objective of this study was to provide a biomechanical comparison of two different types of active chairs (AC1 & AC2) versus a static chair (NAC). Thirty healthy participants were recruited: fifteen healthy females and fifteen healthy males. Participants worked at a computer workstation (1-h per chair). Equipment included: Pressure pads, Electromyography, Nearâ??Infrared Spectroscopy, and Questionnaires (rate of perceived discomfort, seating discomfort questionnaire and exit survey). A significant increase in anteriorâ??posterior postural sway was found on the seat pan with the use of the AC1. An increase in neuromuscular activity of the external obliques and an increase change in total oxygen index (%TOI) values in the gastrocnemius were also found using the AC1, however the difference was not much higher than the NAC and AC2. Lower discomfort scores in the gluteal area were found with the use of active chair AC1 compared to the NAC.

"Recent research has developed two eye-controlled highlighting techniques, namely, block highlight display (BHD) and single highlight display (SHD), that enhance information presentation based on a user's current gaze position. The present research aimed to investigate how these techniques facilitate mental processing of users' visual search in high information-density visual environments. In Experiment 1, 60 participants performed 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-icon visual search tasks. The search times significantly increased as the number of icons increased with the SHD but not with the BHD. In Experiment 2, 40 participants performed a 49-icon visual search task. The search time was faster, and the fixation spatial density was lower with the BHD than with the SHD. These results suggested that the BHD supported parallel processing in the highlighted area and serial processing in the broader display area; thus, the BHD improved search performance compared to the SHD, which primarily supported serial processing.","Eye-controlled highlighting techniques, Visual search, Serial processing, Parallel processing",Yunxian Pan and Xianliang Ge and Liezhong Ge and Jie Xu,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001691,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103522,0003-6870,2021,103522,97,Applied Ergonomics,Using eye-controlled highlighting techniques to support both serial and parallel processing in visual search,article,PAN2021103522
"Recently, motion-based navigation interfaces have been widely utilized in virtual reality (VR) environments. However, improper navigation interfaces can negatively impact the VR experience, and because different interfaces have different characteristics, the navigation experience may vary. Although comparative studies have been conducted with various interfaces, information obtained by focusing on qualitative evaluation was limited. Thus, this study explores the effects from three navigation interfaces (walking-in-place (WIP), joystick, and teleportation) on user performance, sense of presence, workload, usability, and motion sickness through a mixed-method design. Twenty-one participants were asked to perform a navigation task using selected navigation interfaces. The results indicated different advantages and disadvantages in the navigation interfaces for each evaluation metric. In particular, it was found that more research on user safety is required for the WIP interface.

"In the phishing email literature, recent researchers have given much attention to individual differences in phishing susceptibility from the perspective of the Big Five personality traits. Although the effectiveness and advantages of the phishing susceptibility measures in the signal detection theory (SDT) framework have been verified, the cognitive mechanisms that lead to individual differences in these measures remain unknown. The current study proposed and examined a theoretical path model to explore how the Big Five personality traits, related knowledge and experience and the cognitive processing of emails (i.e., mail elaboration) influence usersâ?? susceptibility to phishing emails. A sample of 414 Chinese participants completed the 44-item Big Five Personality Inventory (BFI-44), Mail Elaboration Scale (MES), Web Experience Questionnaire, Experience with Electronic Mail Scale, Knowledge and Technical Background Test and a demographic questionnaire. The phishing susceptibility measures were calculated after the participants finished an email legitimacy task in a role-playing scenario. The results showed that the general profile of the â??victim personalityâ? included low conscientiousness, low openness and high neuroticism, and Internet experience and computer and web knowledge played an important role. All of these factors have significant indirect effects on phishing susceptibility by influencing mail elaboration.

"In this study, the relationship between gaze patterns, task duration, and years of experience, which are commonly used to define and evaluate expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery, was identified. Ten surgeons with 1â??28 years of experience and six inexperienced students were included. Subjects used forceps to repeat the task of suturing a suture pad. Each subject wore an eye-marking recorder, and gaze points were recorded and analyzed. No significant relationship between task duration and gaze pattern was observed. However, there was a significant relationship between a surgeon's years of experience and the percentage of time spent gazing at the forceps. Subjects with more years of experience operated without looking at the forceps and fixed their gaze on the operational target. Therefore, when analyzing laparoscopic gazing patterns, it may be more appropriate to define an â??expertâ? based on the years of experience rather than task duration.","Laparoscopic surgery, Gaze patterns, Definition of expert",Yoshitaka Maeda and Kosuke Oiwa and Shiro Matsumoto and Akio Nozawa and Hiroshi Kawahira,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001216,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103474,0003-6870,2021,103474,96,Applied Ergonomics,Years of experience is more effective in defining experts in the gaze analysis of laparoscopic suturing task than task duration,article,MAEDA2021103474
"Prior research has found that office workers may not be fully utilizing their chair's back support. This may be due in part to cognitive demands or other psychological stressors. Not using the back support may increase the muscle tension and contribute to muscle fatigue and discomfort. Historically, footrests have been advocated to address anthropometric disparities in office settings. In this laboratory study, it was hypothesized that a footrest may facilitate the use of the backrest and mediate the biomechanical demands on the back and neck muscles, especially when cognitive workload is elevated. Twenty participants performed computer tasks, which varied in their complexity levels, both with and without an angled footrest. Using a footrest increased workers' use of a chair's backrest, increased pelvic rotation towards the backrest, and had a corresponding change in spine flexion. However, no changes were found in the sampled electromyographic activities due to the footrest.",,Xueke Wang and Steven A. Lavender and Carolyn M. Sommerich and Michael F.

"Numerous challenges with the implementation, acceptance, and use of health IT are related to poor usability and a lack of integration of the technologies into clinical workflow, and have, therefore, limited the potential of these technologies to improve patient safety. We propose a definition and conceptual model of health IT workflow integration. Using interviews of 12 emergency department (ED) physicians, we identify 134 excerpts of barriers and facilitators to workflow integration of a human factors (HF)-based clinical decision support (CDS) implemented in the ED. Using data on these 134 barriers and facilitators, we distinguish 25 components of workflow integration of the CDS, which are described according to four dimensions of workflow integration: time, flow, scope of patient journey, and level. The proposed definition and conceptual model of workflow integration can be used to inform health IT design; this is the purpose of the proposed checklist that can help to ensure consideration of workflow integration during the development of health IT.","Workflow integration, Health IT, Clinical decision support, Usability, Emergency department",Megan E.

"This research empirically evaluates the introduction of speech to existing keyboard and mouse input modalities in an application used to control aircraft in a simulated, complex and dynamic environment. Task performance and task performance degradation are assessed for three levels of workload. Previous studies have evaluated task performance using these modalities however, only a couple have evaluated task performance under varying workload. Even though speech is a common addition to modern control interfaces, the effect of varying workload on this combination of control modalities has not yet been reported. Thirty-six participants commanded simulated aircraft through generated obstacle courses to reach a Combat Air Patrol (CAP) point while also responding to a secondary task. There were nine conditions that varied the control modality (Keyboard and Mouse (KM), Voice (V), and Keyboard, Mouse and Voice (KMV)), and workload by varying the number of aircraft being controlled (low, medium and high). Results showed that KM outperformed KMV and V for the low and medium workload levels. However, task performance with KMV was found to degrade the least as workload increased. KMV and KM were found to enable significantly more correct responses to the secondary task which was delivered aurally. Participants reported a preference for the combined modalities (KMV), self-assessing that KMV most reduced their workload. This research suggests that the addition of a speech interface to existing keyboard and mouse modalities, for control of aircraft in a simulation, may help manage cognitive load and may assist in controlling more aircraft under higher workloads.","Speech input, Keyboard, Mouse, Control modality, Varied workload conditions, Simulated aircraft control",Maria Vukovic and Lawrence Cavedon and John Thangarajah and Sebastian Rodriguez,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001332,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103486,0003-6870,2021,103486,96,Applied Ergonomics,Performance degrades less under increased workload with the addition of speech control in a dynamic environment,article,VUKOVIC2021103486
"Purpose Although firefighters are required to perform various high-intensity critically essential tasks, the influence of neuromuscular function on firefighter occupational performance is unclear. The primary aim of the current study was to identify the key neuromuscular determinants of stair climb (SC) performance in firefighters. Methods Leg extension isometric peak torque (PT), peak power (PP), torque steadiness at 10% (Steadiness10%) and 50% (Steadiness50%) of PT, fatigability following 30 repeated isotonic concentric contractions at 40% of PT, percent body fat (%BF), and a weighted and timed SC task were examined in 41 (age: 32.3Â Â±Â 8.2Â yrs; %BF: 24.1Â Â±Â 7.9%) male career firefighters. Results Faster SC times (74.7Â Â±Â 13.4Â s) were associated with greater PT and PP, less fatigability, younger age, and lower %BF (rÂ =Â â??0.530â??0.629; PÂ â?¤Â 0.014), but not Steadiness10% or Steadiness50% (PÂ â?¥Â 0.193). Stepwise regression analyses indicated that PP and Steadiness50% were the strongest predictors of SC time (R2Â =Â 0.442, PÂ <Â 0.001). However, when age and %BF were included in the model, these variables became the only significant predictors of SC time (R2Â =Â 0.521, PÂ <Â 0.001) due to age and %BF being collectively associated with all the neuromuscular variables (excluding Steadiness10%). Conclusions Lower extremity neuromuscular function, specifically PP and steadiness, and %BF are important modifiable predictors of firefighter SC performance, which becomes increasingly important in aging firefighters.","Tactical, Stair climb, Muscle strength",Eric D.

"While researchers have explored benefits of adding augmented reality graphics to vehicle displays, the impact of graphic characteristics have not been well researched. In this paper, we consider the impact of augmented reality graphic spatial location and motion, as well as turn direction, traffic presence, and gender, on participant driving and glance behavior and preferences. Twenty-two participants navigated through a simulated environment while using four different graphics. We employed a novel glance allocation analysis to differentiate information likely gathered with each glace with more granularity. Fixed graphics generally resulted in less visual attention and more time scanning for hazards than animated graphics. Finally, the screen-fixed graphic was preferred by participants over all world-relative graphics, suggesting that graphic spatially integration into the world may not always be necessary in visually complex urban environments like those considered in this study.","Augmented reality, Driving, Eye tracking, Graphics",Missie Smith and Joseph L.

"Smartphone use is a risk factor for both neck and shoulder musculoskeletal disorders. The objective of this study was to evaluate an ergonomic arm support prototype device, which may help improve posture while using a smartphone, by determining its effect on muscle activity, muscle fatigue, and neck and shoulder discomfort. Twenty-four healthy young adult smartphone users performed 20Â min of smartphone game playing under two different conditions, smartphone use with support prototype device (i.e. intervention condition) and without (i.e. control condition), while neck and shoulder posture were controlled at 0Â° neck flexion and 30Â° shoulder flexion. Activity and fatigue of four muscles were measured using surface electromyography (sEMG), these were: anterior deltoid (AD), cervical erector spinae (CES), upper trapezius (UT) and lower trapezius (LT). The intervention condition showed significantly decreased activity of all muscles. Fatigue of all muscles, except LT, significantly increased over time compared to the start point in the control condition. There was no significant difference in muscle fatigue between each time point in the intervention condition. In conclusion, the ergonomic arm support prototype device can be used as ergonomic intervention to reduce neck and shoulder muscle loading and fatigue.","Arm support device, Smartphone gaming, Electromyography, Muscle activity, Discomfort score",Weerasak Tapanya and Rungthip Puntumetakul and Manida Swangnetr Neubert and Torkamol Hunsawong and Rose Boucaut,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001058,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103458,0003-6870,2021,103458,95,Applied Ergonomics,Ergonomic arm support prototype device for smartphone users reduces neck and shoulder musculoskeletal loading and fatigue,article,TAPANYA2021103458

"Objective The railway industry in Indonesia has grown substantially in the past five years, with greater network and tracks length that will double in 2030. There has been a growing concern, however, that fatigue among front-line personnel have not been addressed satisfactorily. This study aimed at evaluating the degree of fatigue among passenger train drivers and suggested practical recommendations to the Indonesian Railway Company. Method A total of 32 train drivers (driving for about 4Â h during the morning or afternoon shifts) agreed to participate in the study. Subjective and objective measures of fatigue (and sleepiness) were obtained prior to, during, and immediately following the end of a duty. Fatigue and driving performance were also determined based on (off-line) analysis of continuous video recordings of the drivers performing the duty. Results Fatigue generally increased as a function of time and, for some, 2Â h of driving was sufficient in inducing substantial level of fatigue increase. Unlike the morning shift, the afternoon shift was characterized with increased undue fatigue and unacceptable level of performance decrements. Conclusion In general, fatigue was not found among train drivers working the morning shift. For these drivers, however, there were a couple of individuals with excessive levels of fatigue. The effects of fatigue were more apparent for the afternoon shift. This is possibly due to the degraded sleep quality as a result of split rest periods obtained prior to the duty. It is suggested in this study that the company pay a much closer attention to the work-sleep schedules, and to improve sleep quality by redesigning better sleeping arrangements.","Fatigue, Sleepiness, Train drivers, Video recordings",Hardianto Iridiastadi,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302805,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103332,0003-6870,2021,103332,92,Applied Ergonomics,Fatigue in the Indonesian rail industry: A study examining passenger train drivers,article,IRIDIASTADI2021103332
"The present article provides a systematic overview on the relationship between psychosocial work characteristics and musculoskeletal disorders, absenteeism, and workplace accidents. The study identified and reviewed the findings of 24 systematic reviews or meta-analysis and 6 longitudinal studies. Publications were systematically searched in several databases from 1966 to January 2021. To summarize the level of evidence, a best evidence synthesis was performed, and the quality of included studies was rated. High job demands, high job strain, high effort/reward-imbalance and low social support showed a strong evidence to increase the risk for musculoskeletal disorders. In addition to job demands and job strain, low perceived fairness proved to be a risk factor of absenteeism with strong evidence. Due to the small number of studies, no reliable evidence assessment for workplace accidents was possible. The summarized findings can improve risk assessment methods, by providing a systematic estimation of the potential risk severity of psychosocial work characteristics and assist practitioners in further developing the psychosocial risk assessment.","Psychosocial work characteristics, Risk assessment, Stress",Yacine Taibi and Yannick A.

"With the growing emergence of ergonomic intervention aiming at designing future artefacts, needs analysis is extending to the anticipation of future needs. Both precursory users and experts are known for their deep knowledge of the studied field. In this study, we conducted 36 needs anticipation interviews with ordinary users, precursory users and experts, in order to determine the contribution of each profile to the identification of future needs. The lexical and manual analysis of the interviews shows that the precursory users' speech is the most valuable in terms of both richness and novelty. The discourse of the experts is also richer and more original than that of the ordinary users and differs from that of the precursory users: professional-based for the experts and experience-based for the precursory users. We therefore recommend the inclusion of both experts and precursory users in the need's analysis and anticipation phase.","Precursory users, Needs analysis and anticipation, Prospective ergonomics",Antoine Martin and Marie-France Agnoletti and Ã?ric Brangier,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000417,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103394,0003-6870,2021,103394,94,Applied Ergonomics,"Ordinary users, precursory users and experts in the anticipation of future needs: Evaluation of their contribution in the elaboration of new needs in energy for housing",article,MARTIN2021103394
"Public transport systems are vital services in urban environments. The design of these complex socio-technical systems is continuously evolving to accommodate larger populations, and their adaptation is essential in supporting the successful and sustainable development of cities and regions. An essential part of this adaptation includes working to increase passenger safety and to minimise their risk of injury. With this focus, key objectives of the current study were to identify the causes of slip, trip and fall (STF) incidents attributable to the rail user and to train and station characteristics. An investigation of historical STF records of 1247 train and station incidents in two Australian jurisdictions was conducted. Various contributing factors to STF events were identified, including locations such as stairs, ramps, escalators, the train's entry and exit step, doorway areas, and passenger running or rushing. A mixed-method field study was then conducted at three train stations and on trains. To further investigate the contributing factors, participants (NÂ =Â 40) wore an eye tracker as they navigated the stations and trains. The research illustrates that their continuous search for information, and a disconnect between the information needed and the information provided, might be a cause of passenger distraction and an increase in their risky behaviour. Therefore, we suggest that improvements in information design to reduce the high visual workload for passengers might also reduce the incidence of STFs.","Public transport, Design, Human factors, Slips, Trips and falls, Rail",GrÃ©goire S.

"Quantifying the workload and postural demand on vascular surgeons provides valuable information on the physical and cognitive factors that predispose vascular surgeons to musculoskeletal pain and disorders. The aim of this study was to quantify the postural demand, workload, and discomfort experienced by vascular surgeons and to identify procedural factors that influence surgical workload. Both objective (wearable posture sensors) and subjective (surveys) assessment tools were used to evaluate intraoperative workload during 47 vascular surgery procedures. Results demonstrate unfavorable neck and low back postures as well as high pain scores for those body segments. Additionally, workload from subjective surveys increased significantly as a function of operative duration, and mental workload was high across all procedure types. Neck postural risk exposure and physical demand were among the variables that increased with surgical duration, procedure type, and loupes used by the surgeons. Correlations among postural angles and pain scores showed consistency between the objective assessment and the subjective surveys for neck and trunk. The authors believe that the results of this study highlight the need for developing mitigating measures such as ergonomic interventions for vascular surgery.","Vascular surgery, Loupes, Lead vest, Open vascular surgery, Endovascular surgery, Hybrid surgery, Workload, SURG-TLX, IMU, Surgeon well-being",Hamid Norasi and Emmanuel Tetteh and Samuel R.

"Ride comfort in vehicles can be affected by seat properties. While previous studies focused on the vertical whole-body vibration, this study was designed to understand the influence of the foam thickness at the seat pan and at the backrest on seat transmissibilities with fore-and-aft vibration. Twelve subjects sitting with or without a vertical backrest were exposed to random fore-and-aft vibration between 1 and 15Â Hz with the magnitude of 0.5Â msâ??2 r.m.s.. It was found that there was no significant difference in the primary resonance frequencies in the fore-and-aft in-line and vertical cross-axis transmissibilities to the seat pan and to the backrest.

"In hand-held human machine systems the biodynamic response of the human hand arm system influences the overall dynamic behavior. The biodynamic response of the hand arm system is affected by several influencing factors. These influencing factors include the feed force, body posture, gripping force, and anthropometric properties. In present studies the importance of the gripping force on the biodynamic response is highlighted. In the state of the art; however, the magnitude of gripping forces as well as the influence of the human factors body posture and feed force on hammer drills for a larger group of professional users is unclear. To analyze the influence that these human factors have on hammer drill vibrations, a study with 15 professional power tool test personnel has been conducted. Characteristic gripping force values have been measured (Median: 84Â Nâ??156Â N at the main handle, 10Â Nâ??30Â N on the auxiliary handle) for different feed forces (100Â N, 150Â N, 200Â N) and body postures. Then the influence of body posture, feed force, and gripping force on the hammer drill vibration is determined. A significant influence of the body posture (ANOVA: pÂ =Â .003, rÂ =Â .367) on the RMS acceleration of the main handle was observed. Furthermore, the feed force has a significant influence on the vibration of the hammer-drill for some groups. The data also demonstrates that for increasing gripping forces, the RMS of the acceleration and frequency weighted acceleration ahv on the main and auxiliary handle decrease. The findings of this study represent a starting point for the development of adjustable hand-arm models for the reproducible vibration assessment of power tools.","Hand-arm vibration, Hammer drilling, Gripping forces, Human factors, Power tool, Human-machine system",A.

"Occupational tasks often involve musculoskeletal demands that contribute to injury risk. In pallet wrapping tasks, 36% of workplace claims involve over exertion and repetitive exposures (Workplace Safety and Prevention Services, 2012). Tools that modify how the wrap is handled by workers have been introduced to help mitigate over exertion and extreme postures wherever possible. A novel device has been introduced that places the required tension on the roll to mitigate these factors. However, the effect of reducing the necessary tension on the roll during pallet wrapping in limiting muscular demand and extreme postures is unknown. Fourteen healthy university aged participants completed 12 wrapping trials on a simulated pallet (2 repetitions of 2 wrapping techniques (device, hand wrapping) at 3 wrapping heights (low, medium, high)). Surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured on 6 shoulder and 2 low back muscles; anterior and middle deltoids, biceps brachii, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, upper trapezius, and erector spinae (T8 & L3). Kinematic data were collected for the torso and upper extremity and global to torso, and torso to upper arm angles were computed. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed for the following experimental factors: 1) technique used (device or hand wrapping) and 2) the wrapping height (low, medium, high) for each muscle (8), angle (5), rating of perceived discomfort (1) and rating of perceived exertion (1). Pallet wrapping without a device required greater trunk flexion at lower heights and thoracohumeral elevation at higher wrapping heights as compared to using the device. Muscular activation increased when using the device, specifically at the higher and lower heights. Posture and muscular demands during pallet wrapping tasks are sensitive to both wrapping technique and wrapping height. Ergonomics interventions such as this device may mitigate postural risks associated with manual material handling tasks.","Occupational exposures, Manual exertions, Pallet wrapping",Jacquelyn M.

"A prototype assistive therapy chair (T-Chair) that induces exercise stimuli to improve trunk control and standing and walking early after stroke has been developed. The aim of this study was to assess its usability in a rehabilitation setting. Eleven physical therapists (PTs) integrated the T-Chair into the therapy programs of 15 patients post stroke. Each patient performed on average four individual therapy sessions on the T-Chair under the PTs' supervision. Usability was assessed using questionnaires, therapy diaries and focus group interviews with PTs'. Among PTsâ??, 64% had generally a positive view on the T-Chair. Physical therapists recognized the potential for unsupervised therapy. Generally, patients reacted positively and enjoyed training. The T-Chair has the potential to become an adequate training tool for patients with an intermediate trunk control after stroke.

A laboratory experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of each NDRT attribute on the corresponding stage of the process of taking over control. A prediction model was developed using the results of multiple linear regression analysis. Additionally, a validation experiment with nine NDRTs and a baseline condition was conducted to determine the extent to which the developed model explains the takeover time for each NDRT condition.

"Through music, film composers attempt to affect the audience's emotions and visual attention; however, little empirical evidence exists characterizing the mechanisms whereby music affects viewers. We conducted a mixed-design experiment with 60 participants to explore the effect of music on viewers' visual attention and affective responses to a film. Music led to quicker first fixations on film objects and supplied emotional content, increasing positive sentiment for the film's story. However, music did not influence viewers' attitudes to filmed events. Within this context, music has limited impact on attitudes toward filmed events but can accentuate the saliency of film objects and supply emotional information altering viewers' sentiment towards the film. Understanding the mechanisms of music's physiological and behavioral effects can inform content delivery strategies. This study offers insights for composition and production of musical soundtracks for feature-length films, advertising videos, educational videos, and video games.","Physiological measurement, Eye tracking, Emotional response, Visual attention, Film music, Soundtrack",Barbara Millet and Juan Chattah and Soyeon Ahn,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302490,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103301,0003-6870,2021,103301,93,Applied Ergonomics,Soundtrack design: The impact of music on visual attention and affective responses,article,MILLET2021103301
"Office workers can spend significant periods of time being stationary whilst at work, with potentially serious health consequences. The development of effective health interventions could be aided by a greater understanding of the location and environmental context in which this stationary behaviour occurs. Real time location systems (RTLS) potentially offer the opportunity to gather this much needed information, but they have not been extensively trialled in office workplaces, nor rigorously compared against more familiar devices such as accelerometers. The aim of this paper was to determine whether an RTLS can measure and spatially locate the non-stationary and stationary behaviours of adults working in an office work environment. Data collected from a series of comparison studies undertaken in a commercial office building suggests that RTLS can measure the velocity at which people are moving and locate them, when stationary, with an accuracy of 0.668Â m (SD 0.389). This opens up significant opportunities to further understand how people move within buildings, the indoor physical environmental influences on that movement, and the development of effective interventions to help people to move more whilst at work.","Real time location system, Accelerometer, Office, Stationary behaviour, Physical inactivity, Free-living behaviour",Brett Pollard and Lina Engelen and Fabian Held and Richard {de Dear},https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302891,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103341,0003-6870,2021,103341,92,Applied Ergonomics,"Movement at work: A comparison of real time location system, accelerometer and observational data from an office work environment",article,POLLARD2021103341
"Falls during stair descent pose a major health concern. A stronger understanding of recovery from balance loss during stair descent is needed to guide fall prevention strategies and environmental design. We characterized balance recovery strategies, trunk and center-of-mass (COM) kinematics, and handrail use following unexpected forward balance loss during stair descent, and the effect of perturbation magnitude on these outcomes. Eighteen young adults experienced a rapid platform translation during stair descent to disrupt balance. Deception was used to reduce anticipation. All participants used compensatory stepping to recover balance, and most applied forces to the handrail in multiple directions. Higher perturbation magnitude resulted in higher COM velocity and handrail forces, more frequent incomplete steps, and quicker step contact time. Our findings provide a foundation for understanding balance recovery on stairs. The findings emphasize the importance of designing stairways that enable compensatory stepping, and handrails that permit adequate force generation in multiple directions to facilitate balance recovery on stairs.","Balance recovery, Stair ambulation, Fall prevention",Philippa Gosine and Vicki Komisar and Alison C.

"Shared perceptions of a task among those responsible for its completion are important for achieving successful outcomes. This study proposes a framework for eliciting various aspects of team members' â??mental modelsâ? (TMMs) of complex medical tasks. The intention is to provide â??proof of conceptâ?? for a methodology to measure similarities and differences between team members' perceptions of selected attributes of the task. Applying our framework in a gynecology ward, we use cognitive interviewing and concept mapping to reveal differences between the TMMs of doctor and nurse teams. These group differences are found to reflect limited awareness of the other group's level of involvement, workload, responsibilities and contributions to quality of care. We argue that such differences may lead to frustration, conflict, poor teamwork and risks to patient safety; but once identified, and subject to certain limitations, the differences could be used to develop interventions that will enhance teamwork.","Teamwork, Mental models, Process failures, Treatment quality, Patient safety, Work structure and content",Ido Morag and Ariel L.

"Objective Providing instruction for assembly tasks is essential in modern manufacturing industry, as well as in households for customers that buy products to be assembled at home. Recent technological developments might be able to assist in completing an assembly task faster and more accurately. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether performance and usability differs when instructions for an assembly task are presented on digital glasses versus paper. Methods Participants (nÂ =Â 63) completed one of three versions of an assembly task (between-subject-design) with LEGOÂ® bricks: (1) with paper instruction (P), (2) with text instructions presented stepwise via digital glasses (GT), (3) with stepwise text and auditory instruction (in parallel) on digital glasses (GA). Outcome measures on performance were completion time and errors. Furthermore, usability was measured by the User Experience Questionnaire, the Standardized Usability Questionnaire, the Post-Study Usability Questionnaire, and cognitive processing skills were assessed by the Trail Making Test and different versions of the Eriksen Flanker Task. Analyses were adjusted for the confounding factors age, gender, experience with glasses and LEGO, and problems with instruction. Results Findings indicate that task completion was faster with the paper instructions compared to both versions of instruction via digital glasses (GT, GA). We observed no difference in accuracy and usability between the instructions. â??Noveltyâ? was rated higher for instructions for both GT and GA, compared to P. Discussion Results show that instructions on digital glasses may not always be more effective for assembly than the traditional paper-based instructions. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether effectiveness may depend on task complexity, target group, experience of the user with task and device, and how the information is presented.","Data glasses, Digital glasses, Smart eyewear device, Smart glasses, Google glasses, Head-mounted display, Assembly task, LEGOÂ®, Assistance, Assistance systems, Instructions, Assembly experiment",Francisca S.

"Manual material handling is common in supermarkets and may be a contributing factor to the high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, particularly to the lower back. This cross-sectional study applied state-of-the-art musculoskeletal models driven by kinematic data obtained in two supermarkets to estimate joint reaction forces in the knees, shoulders and lumbar spine under dynamic lifting conditions. Based on 1479 lifts from 15 workers, 8 tasks for which the compression or shear forces in the L5-S1 joint exceeded well-known biomechanical tolerance limits were identified. High shoulder forces were associated with lifting relatively heavy merchandise to high shelves, while the weight of the handled merchandise was the main predictor of high knee forces. The study addressed well-known limitations associated with traditional lifting analysis tools and was the first to present a detailed analysis of the biomechanical loads during manual material handling tasks in the supermarket sector based on field measurements.","Musculoskeletal modelling, Inertial motion capture, Musculoskeletal diseases",Sebastian Skals and RÃºni BlÃ¡foss and Lars Louis Andersen and Michael Skipper Andersen and Mark {de Zee},https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302933,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103345,0003-6870,2021,103345,92,Applied Ergonomics,"Manual material handling in the supermarket sector.

"Introduction Military leaders must understand how modern military equipment loads affect trade-offs between movement speed and physiological strain to optimize pacing strategies. Purpose To evaluate the effects of load carried in a recently developed military backpack on the walking speed and cardiometabolic responses of dismounted warfighters. Methods Fifteen soldiers (1 woman, 14 men; age, 22Â Â±Â 2 years; height, 173Â Â±Â 7Â cm; body mass (BM), 73Â Â±Â 10Â kg) completed incremental walking tests with four external load conditions (0, 22, 44, or 66% BM) using the US Army's newest backpack: the Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment 4000 (MOLLE 4000). Oxygen uptake (VÌ?O2) and heart rate (HR) were evaluated relative to maximal values (VÌ?O2max and HRmax respectively). Testing ceased when participants completed the highest tested speed (1.97Â mÂ sâ??1), exceeded a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of 1.00, or reached volitional exhaustion. Results Peak speed significantly decreased (pÂ <Â 0.03) with successively heavier loads (0% BM, 1.95Â Â±Â 0.06Â mÂ sâ??1; 22% BM, 1.87Â Â±Â 0.10Â mÂ sâ??1; 44% BM, 1.69Â Â±Â 0.13Â mÂ sâ??1; 66% BM, 1.48Â Â±Â 0.13Â mÂ sâ??1). Peak VÌ?O2 was significantly lower (pÂ <Â 0.01) with 0% BM (47Â Â±Â 5% VÌ?O2max) than each load (22% BM, 58Â Â±Â 8% VÌ?O2max; 44% BM, 63Â Â±Â 10% VÌ?O2max; 66% BM, 61Â Â±Â 11% VÌ?O2max). Peak HR was significantly lower (pÂ <Â 0.01) with 0% BM (71Â Â±Â 5% HRmax) versus each load (22% BM, 83Â Â±Â 6% HRmax; 44% BM, 87Â Â±Â 6% HRmax; 66% BM, 88Â Â±Â 6% HRmax). Conclusion Overburdened warfighters suffer severe impairments in walking speed even when carrying recently developed military load carriage equipment. Our results suggest that the relative work intensity of heavy load carriage may be better described when expressed relative to HRmax versus VÌ?O2max.","Cardiorespiratory, Energy expenditure, Exercise metabolism, Fatigue, Movement economy, Oxygen cost",David P.

"Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are highly prevalent in the supermarket sector with manual material handling being one of the most commonly identified occupational risk factors. This cross-sectional study applied inertial motion capture and electromyography (EMG) to measure full-body kinematics and muscle activity of trapezius descendens and erector spinae longissimus during 50 manual material handling tasks performed by 17 workers in two supermarkets. The handling of bread and cucumbers to high shelf heights showed the highest trapezius muscle activity (from 47% to 59% peak normalized EMG), while the handling of bananas as well as lifting milk, bread and cucumbers from low to high positions showed the highest erector spinae activity (from 59% to 71%). Twenty-two tasks involved flexing the shoulders and trunk more than 90Â° and 50Â°, respectively. Based on these results, several manual handling practices in supermarkets should be reconsidered to reduce the physical work demands.","Musculoskeletal diseases, Lifting, Grocery stores",Sebastian Skals and RÃºni BlÃ¡foss and Michael Skipper Andersen and Mark {de Zee} and Lars Louis Andersen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702030288X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103340,0003-6870,2021,103340,92,Applied Ergonomics,Manual material handling in the supermarket sector.

"One task of CCTV operation is to decide whether footage shown in videos depicts criminal behaviour, or allows a viewer to predict its occurrence. An increasing prevalence of cameras in the world, means an increase in screens in the control room. This presents a signal-to-noise challenge where the signal (criminal activity) may become more difficult to detect amongst the noise. We used signal detection approaches to understand which factors were associated with decision-making in a CCTV task. When detecting aggressive incidents, higher conscientiousness was associated with making better decisions, with a higher criterion for responding (meaning fewer false-positive responses). However, conscientious individuals tended to be less confident (in multiplex displays), and were slower in responding â?? which reflects that these individuals require more evidence to make these decisions. Higher trait cognitive anxiety was again associated with making earlier responses, while extraversion was also associated with earlier responding in multiplexed displays. Taken in combination, our results suggest that there is a fine balance between making correct decisions, and making early decisions â?? and that these need to be considered together in the CCTV task.","CCTV, Decision-making, Personality, Anxiety, Threat detection",Matthew J.

"The aim of this study was to understand why and how working in the oil industry causes job stress. Using the work-systems model as a guiding framework, we conducted 15 in-depth interviews with employees of an oil company located on an island in the Persian Gulf to investigate work system-related stressors. The interviews were audio-taped, and qualitative content data analysis was carried out continuously and simultaneously with data collection over a 12-month period. 1118 meaning codes were extracted which could be understood though fourteen categories of stressor associated with the five themes of the work system. Employees reported the job was stressful primarily because of organizational structural problems and management attributes, although aspects of living and working on the small island were also difficult. These results provide direction for intervention that can dovetail with risk assessment of occupational health of workers.","Work-related stress, Macroergonomics, Sociotechnical system theory, Organization ergonomics, Work schedules",Hamidreza Mokarami and Rosanna Cousins and Alireza Choobineh,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000545,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103407,0003-6870,2021,103407,94,Applied Ergonomics,Understanding job stress in The Iranian oil industry: A qualitative analysis based on the work systems model and macroergonomics approach,article,MOKARAMI2021103407
"This study investigated the effects of simulating self-motion via a head-mounted display (HMD) on standing postural sway and spatial presence. Standing HMD users viewed simulated oscillatory self-motion in depth. On a particular trial, this naso-occipital visual oscillation had one of four different amplitudes (either 4, 8, 12 or 16Â m peak-to-peak) and one of four different frequencies (either 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 or 1Â Hz). We found that simulated high amplitude self-oscillation (approximately 16Â m peak-to-peak) at either 0.25Â Hz or 0.5Â Hz: 1) generated the strongest effects on postural sway; and 2) made participants feel more spatially present in the virtual environment. Our findings provide insight into the parameters of simulated self-motion that generate the strongest postural responses within virtual environments. These postural constraints have valuable implications for improving our understanding of sensory processes underlying the ergonomic experience of virtual environments simulated using HMDs.","Self-motion perception, Vision, Head-mounted display (HMD), Presence, Postural stability",Nahian S.

"This study sought to test the validity of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to measure indoor stair walking. RFID and Bluetooth sensors (accelerometers with the proximity function) were placed at landings across three floors within a stairwell. Participants (nÂ =Â 29) were randomized to stair walking or sedentary control and concomitantly wore RFID tags at the hip, chest and neck. An accelerometer worn at the hip captured criterion physical activity data. RFID devices detected sedentary control and stair walking participants (mean RFID detections: 15.50, 47.33 respectively). Neck lanyard RFID tags were detected most frequently. RFID correctly classified all participants in both groups. RFID-based energy expenditure estimates were strongly correlated with accelerometer estimates (rÂ =Â 0.78â??0.94). Percent agreement for floor detection between the Bluetooth and RFID readers (38.6%) was consistent with known limitations of Bluetooth proximity sensing. It is concluded that, during self-paced stair walking in young adults, RFID devices provide valid data on participant movement and estimated energy expenditure.","Exercise, Energy expenditure, Measurement, Stairs, Technology, Walking",Jennifer L.

"This paper presents the results of an extensive survey concerning the experience of safety footwear end-users. Safety footwear has been in widespread use across many industries worldwide since the 1970s, and has become an essential part of industrial Personal Protective Equipment. The number of women entering predominantly male industrial environments, and requiring safety footwear is rising, and this is accompanied by anecdotal reports of ill-fitting and uncomfortable footwear. This research proactively compares the opinions of women and men regarding their experience of safety footwear. A systematically designed survey aims to substantiate previously anecdotal knowledge around safety footwear, including key drivers for end-user purchases, wear habits and comfort issues (establishing any differences between women and men). Chi-squared testing was used to assess statistical significance and ensure robustness of findings. The responses and resulting analysis confirmed that comfort and fit were key drivers for all end users; women and men have different wear habits (women wear their safety footwear less frequently and for shorter periods of time than men â?? likely due to the reported comfort issues); a significant proportion of women (60%) found their safety footwear less comfortable than their regular footwear, however, 45% of men also reported the same, which has not been reported anecdotally. In general, the users of safety footwear accepted a level of discomfort in at least one area of the foot before deeming footwear â??uncomfortableâ??. The significant analysis performed on the captured data has, to the authors knowledge, never before been undertaken for this breadth of industry, age and gender with 632 responses received. This makes it the largest study of this field to date.","Safety footwear, Survey, Comfort, Fit, PPE, Personal Protective Equipment",D. Janson and S.T. Newman and V.

"This study evaluated whole body vibration (WBV), non-driving task performance, muscle activity, and self-reported discomfort and motion sickness between different seat suspension systems in a simulated vehicle environment. In a repeated-measures laboratory experiment where field-measured 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) passenger vehicle vibration was replicated on a 6-DOF motion platform, we measured WBV, non-driving task (pointing, typing, web-browsing, and reading) performance, low back (erector spinae), shoulders (trapezius) and neck (splenius capitis and sternocleido-mastoid) muscle activity, and self-reported discomfort and motion sickness from three different seats: a vertical (z-axis) active suspension, multi-axial active suspension [vertical (z-axis)Â +Â lateral (y-axis)], and a static suspension-less seat (current seat type in all passenger cars). Both the vertical and multi-axial active suspension seats significantly reduced the vertical WBV exposure (pÂ <Â 0.0001). However, no significant differences were found in non-driving task performance (pÂ >Â 0.30), muscle activity (pÂ >Â 0.22), self-reported discomfort (pÂ >Â 0.07), and motion sickness (pÂ =Â 0.53) across three different seats. These findings indicate that the active suspension seats may have potential to future reduce the vertical and total WBV exposures, respectively. However, none of the suspension seats demonstrate any significant benefits on the non-driving task performance, muscle activity, self-reported discomfort and motion sickness measures in a simulated vehicle environment.","Engineering control, Multi-axial vibration, Human-computer interaction",Kiana Kia and Peter W.

"There is sparse research directly investigating the effects of trust manipulations in human-human and human-robot interactions. Moreover, studies on human-human versus human-robot trust have leveraged unusual or low vulnerability contexts to investigate such effects and have focused mostly on robot performance. In the present research, we seek to remedy these limitations and compare trust in human-human versus human-robot collaborations in an augmented and adapted version of the Trust Game. We used a mixed factorial design to examine the effects of trust and trust violations on human-human and human-robot interactions over time with an emphasis on anthropomorphic robots in a social context. We found consistent and significant effects of partner behavior. Specifically, partner distrust behaviors led to participantsâ?? lower levels of trustworthiness perceptions, trust intentions, and trust behaviors over time compared to partner trust behaviors. We found no significant effect of partnering with a human versus an anthropomorphic robot over time across the three dependent variables, supporting the computers as social actors (CASA; Nass and Moon, 2000) paradigm. This study demonstrated that there may be instances where the effects of trust violations from an anthropomorphized robot partner are not meaningfully different from those of a human partner in a social context.","Trust violations, Automation bias, Human-robot interaction",Gene M.

"Direct-measurement-based methods for assessing workloads of the hand or elbow in the field are rare. Aim of the study was to develop such a method based on the Threshold Limit Value for Hand Activity Level (TLV for HAL). Hence, HAL was quantified using kinematic data (mean power frequencies, angular velocities and micro-pauses) and combined with electromyographic data (root-mean-square values) in order to generate a measurement-based TLV for HAL (mTLV for HAL). The multi-sensor system CUELA including inertial sensors, potentiometers and a 4-channel surface electromyography module was used. For wrist and elbow regions, associations between mTLV for HAL and disorders/complaints (quantified by odds ratios (OR [95%-confidence interval])) were tested exploratively within a cross-sectional field study with 500 participants. Higher workloads were frequently significantly associated with arthrosis of distal joints (9.23 [3.29â??25.87]), wrist complaints (2.89 [1.63â??5.11]) or elbow complaints (1.99 [1.08â??3.67]).

"Background Soldiers are required to conduct tasks and operations in physically demanding situations, where the ability to move (mobility) quickly is important to lethality and survivability. This study employed a specially designed suit to try to isolate the main mass property characteristics of personal protective clothing/equipment (PPCE) including mass, bulk and stiffness as much as possible and evaluated their effects on soldier performance across operationally-relevant mobility tasks. Method Eight male military subjects performed the load effects assessment program (LEAP) obstacle course while wearing 7 different configurations of specifically designed suit: unencumbered (control), 10Â kg mass, 30Â kg mass, 20Â L bulk, medium stiffness, high stiffness and a mixed configuration consisting of 10Â kg mass, 20Â L bulk and medium stiffness. The primary outcome measure was total LEAP completion time. Additionally, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), range of motion and vertical jump heights were measured and related to LEAP performance. Results All configurations degraded or tended to degrade the total LEAP completion times (p-valueÂ <Â 0.05), except for the medium stiffness configuration.

"Aim To determine how well decision tree models can predict tailor-assigned uniform sizes using anthropometry data from the New Zealand Defence Force Anthropometry Survey (NZDFAS). This information may inform automatic sizing systems for military personnel. Methods Anthropometric data from two separate samples of the New Zealand Defence Force military were used. Data on Army personnel from the NZDFAS (nÂ =Â 583) were used to develop a series of shirt- and trouser-size prediction models based on decision trees. Different combinations of physical, automatic, and post-processed measurements (the latter two derived from a 3D body scan) were trialled, and the models with the highest cross-validation accuracy were retained. The accuracy of these models were then tested on an independent sample of Army recruits (nÂ =Â 154). Results The automated measurement method (measurements derived automatically by the body scanner software) were the best predictors of shirt size (58.1% accuracy) and trouser size (61.7%), with body weight and waist girth being the strongest predictors. Clothing sizes that were incorrectly predicted by the model where generally one size above or below the tailor-predicted size. Conclusions Anthropometry measurements, when used with decision tree models, show promise for classifying clothing size. Methodological changes such as fitting gender-specific models, using additional anthropometry variables, and testing other data mining techniques are avenues for future work. More research is required before fully automated body scanning is a viable option for obtaining fast and accurate clothing sizes for military clothing and logistics departments.","Anthropometry, 3-D body scanning, Decision tree, CART, Clothing size",Stephven Kolose and Tom Stewart and Patria Hume and Grant R.

"As the prevalence of obesity grows worldwide, it becomes an increasing concern in working populations. Ergonomists are faced with the challenge of accommodating workplace layouts to include this worker demographic. This study investigated the relationship between shoulder and low back isometric joint strengths across body mass index (BMI) groups. Additionally, relationships between body fat percentage (BF%), absolute strength, and strength normalized to body mass were examined. Ninety, healthy, working age participants performed 11 functional and isometric joint strength exertions. BMI group influenced normalized strength, as the obese 2+ (BMI >35.0) group had up to 63.1% lower joint strength than all other BMI groups (pÂ <Â 0.05). Significant strong to moderate negative linear relationships existed between BF% and normalized strength for both males and females, and relationships were stronger for females. These strength deficits highlight the importance of considering body composition during ergonomics analyses and configuration of occupational tasks.","Obesity, BMI, Body composition, Strength, Occupational injury",Brittany D.

"The present experimental study involved 346 university students without self-reported disability and investigated the perceived symbolic meanings of the International Symbol of Accessibility (ISA) along with its associations with stereotypes toward wheelchair users and the perceived inclusiveness of the social climate. Participants were randomized into four groups with exposure to either the ISA, Motion-symbol, Universal-Design-symbol, or all-symbols. The results showed that different symbols were associated with different patterns of perceived symbolic meanings. Exposure to the Universal-Design-symbol, which emphasizes equality (but not the Motion-symbol, which emphasizes autonomy), was significantly and indirectly associated with relatively lower stereotypes toward wheelchair users (and perceived less inclusive social climate) through associating the Universal-Design-symbol with relatively lower perceived symbolic meanings of â??Passiveâ? and â??Labelingâ? (and â??Passiveâ?) compared to exposure to the ISA. Recommendations for a contextual-dependent replacement of symbol, the methodology of implicit association tests, and the usage of symbols of access in cartography were discussed.","Ableism, Universal design, Critical cartography",Gloria Y.K.

"The research represents one of the first major qualitative studies to subjectively investigate fatigue amongst city bus drivers. Funded by TfL (grant no. 94050), the study considers the perspectives of both the bus drivers themselves and their managers. It explores opinion specifically in relation to how fatigue influences or is influenced by bus driving, and how this is managed. Data was collected from focus groups with bus drivers (nÂ =Â 65 drivers) and one-to-one interviews with bus driver managers (nÂ =Â 11). Fatigue was seen to be a problem, with all drivers having experienced for themselves the feeling of sleepiness whilst driving the bus, or knowing about it in others. The managers agreed that fatigue amongst drivers is evident, seeing it particularly as a contributor to serious incidents. Fatigue and sleepiness are not discussed between drivers as a general rule and they do not feel comfortable reporting instances of fatigue for fear of being disciplined. Managers would encourage drivers to report these issues and therefore hoped to create a more open culture. Factors identified as contributors to fatigue included: working overtime, having insufficient sleep, spending time with family, other non-work commitments, shift schedules, and work pressure.","Fatigue, Sleepiness, Bus drivers, Focus groups, Interviews, Road safety",Sally Maynard and Ashleigh Filtness and Karl Miller and Fran Pilkington-Cheney,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702030257X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103309,0003-6870,2021,103309,92,Applied Ergonomics,Bus driver fatigue: A qualitative study of drivers in London,article,MAYNARD2021103309
"Current taxonomies for assessing foot strategies in manual material handling lack exhaustive classification of foot movements and foot positioning. They also fail to consider different instants of the task as checkpoints to relate foot strategies. The goal of the study was first to develop a new taxonomy to assess foot positions and motions considering those limitations. The second goal was to assess reliability and reproducibility using raw agreement percentages, Cohen's kappa, prevalence-adjusted, bias-adjusted kappa and Gwet's AC1. A filmed task consisted of transferring boxes from one pallet to another. Intra- and inter-rater reliability were assessed reviewing 23% and 10%, respectively, of video data. Reproducibility and reliability results are substantial and almost perfect on average. In comparison to similar studies, reproducibility and reliability were considered acceptable.","Footstep strategies, Step, Classification",Jasmin VallÃ©e Marcotte and Antoine Muller and Xavier Robert-Lachaine and VÃ©ronique Fecteau and Denys Denis and AndrÃ© Plamondon and Philippe Corbeil,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000715,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103424,0003-6870,2021,103424,94,Applied Ergonomics,New taxonomy for assessing manual material handlersâ?? footstep patterns,article,MARCOTTE2021103424
"In order to be able to develop a hammer drill with which the user can work as ergonomically and productively as possible, the relevant influencing factors must be known. In addition to the unknown influence of the drilling direction, there is a lack of understanding of the relations between user forces, human fatigue, and productivity. To analyze these relations, an experiment was carried out with 15 professional users. First, the influence of feed force, drilling direction, and drill bit on the rate of penetration was examined. Taking into account the rate of penetration and human fatigue, it was then investigated which of the three feed forces produces the highest productivity. Furthermore, the lateral forces applied by the participants during the drilling process were analyzed. Based on the study, it was found that the drilling direction (pÂ <Â .001, rÂ =Â â??0.198) and the drill bit type (pÂ <Â .041, rÂ =Â â??0.16) have a significant influence on the rate of penetration. Moreover, it was found that the rate of penetration tends to increase with higher feed forces, however, the theoretical cumulative drilling meters decrease when taking user fatigue into account. Finally, the experiment showed that the participating professionals applied lateral forces (MdnÂ =Â 16.7Â N) of 13% to the feed force when working with a hammer drill. On the basis of this knowledge, investigations can be done to analyze the influences of lateral forces on the drilling process. The findings help drill and hammer drill manufacturers in testing and development processes. For craftsmen, on the other hand, the knowledge helps to perform the task as ergonomically and time-efficiently as possible.","Lateral forces, Human factors, Human-machine interaction, Power tool",Michael Uhl and Andreas Lindenmann and Sven Matthiesen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302866,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103338,0003-6870,2021,103338,92,Applied Ergonomics,"Analysis of factors influencing the productivity of hammer drilling â?? user forces, human fatigue, drilling direction, and drill bit",article,UHL2021103338
"Despite female soldiers representing a growing user population, military body armour systems are currently better suited to the anthropometric dimensions of male soldiers. The aim of this study was to explore issues that female soldiers experience with current Australian Defence Force (ADF)-issue body armour. Following a sequential exploratory design, an initial questionnaire was completed by 97 Australian female soldiers. Subsequently, 33 Australian female soldiers participated in one of three focus groups. Descriptive statistics of questionnaire data considered alongside thematic analysis of focus group transcripts revealed problems with the design (fit, form and function) of current ADF-issue body armour, as well as problems with the issuance and education surrounding use of the system. It is recommended that anthropometric data of female soldiers be better incorporated into future body armour designs, that these data inform processes surrounding both acquisition and issuance of body armour and that training protocols for body armour use be reviewed.","Protective equipment, Body armour, Female soldier",Celeste.E.

"In healthcare, most accidents occur as a result of inadequate interactions between system components rather than component failures. In such cases traditional risk analysis methods are of limited use for analysing system safety, so methods such as Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) have been developed. This study uses STPA to assess risks in the sepsis treatment process, discusses the potential value STPA adds and compares the results of STPA with the results of another study that used FRAM. The findings indicate that STPA and FRAM have different strengths which reflect the different scientific approaches behind these two methods. FRAM facilitates an in-depth understanding of a system, while STPA allows for more comprehensive risk analysis by identifying more risks, scenarios and safety recommendations. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to say that not only does STPA provide more comprehensive risk analysis; its terminology and philosophy are also closer to the current safety management applications employed in complex systems.","Risk analysis, STPA, Healthcare, System safety",Gulsum Kubra Kaya,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000557,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103408,0003-6870,2021,103408,94,Applied Ergonomics,A system safety approach to assessing risks in the sepsis treatment process,article,KAYA2021103408
"Purpose To analyze progression of changes in kinematics and work physiology during progressive lifting in healthy adults. Methods Healthy participants were recruited. A standardized lifting test from the WorkWell Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) was administered, with five progressive lifting low series of five repetitions. The criteria of the WorkWell observation protocol were studied: changes in muscle use (EMG), heart rate (heart rate monitor), base of support, posture and movement pattern (motion capture system). Repeated measures ANOVA's were used to analyze changes during progressive workloads. Results 18 healthy young adults participated (8 men, 10 women; mean age 22 years). Mean maximum weight lifted was 66 (Â±3.2) and 44 (Â±7.4) kg for men and women, respectively. With progressive loads, statistically significant (pÂ <Â 0.01) differences were observed: increase in secondary muscle use at moderate lifting, increase of heart rate, increase of base of support and movement pattern changes were observed; differences in posture were not significant. Conclusions Changes in 4 out of 5 kinematic and work physiology parameters were objectively quantified using lab technology during progressive lifting in healthy adults. These changes appear in line with existing observation criteria.","Functional capacity evaluation, Observation, Motion analyses, Electromyography, Heart rate.

"As the nature of human-robot relationships have become increasingly bound to shift from supervisorâ??machine to friendâ??companion, people have exhibited an increasing interest in making social judgments toward such anthropomorphic objects, such as trustworthiness. However, the facial features of social robots and their potential effect on anthropomorphic trustworthiness are seldom analyzed and discussed comprehensively. This study examined whether the trustworthiness perception toward a social robot shared similarity with baby schema features on the human face. It also explored the effects of different combinations of baby schema facial features, especially the positions and sizes of the eyes and mouth, on facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness. A 5-way mixed experiment (NÂ =Â 270) was conducted accordingly. The results indicated that people would experience a high level of facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness toward robots with baby schema features (i.e., large eyes, with medium vertical and horizontal positions of the eyes and mouth). This paper contributes to the literature on facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness in human-robot interaction and provides suggestions for social robot design.","Social robot, Facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness, Baby schema, Eyes, Mouth",Yao Song and Ameersing Luximon and Yan Luximon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000673,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103420,0003-6870,2021,103420,94,Applied Ergonomics,The effect of facial features on facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness in social robots,article,SONG2021103420
"Various researchers have proposed pupillometric indicators to assess a person's cognitive strain. However, to distinguish the variation of pupil light response from psychosensory pupil response in experimental field conditions is a challenge. The Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA) addresses this problem by wavelet separation. This research investigates the ICA's sensitivity for multiple level task-evoked cognitive activity and visual influences concerning informational work tasks. Objective and subjective measures assessed cognitive strain of participants (NÂ =Â 22) during various tasks. In a first experiment, mental arithmetic tasks were used to induce different levels of cognitive activity. In a second experiment, influences of screen polarity and presentation of information were investigated (NÂ =Â 18). The results indicate that eye metrics are rarely sensitive to slight variations in task difficulty. Moreover, the ICA is likely to be sensitive towards constant screen illumination and shows tendencies regarding changes in displayed information. Possible ramifications for the objective assessment of cognitive strain are discussed.","Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA), Visual stimuli, Workload",Julia N.

"The main purpose of this study was to model and analyze hospital to home transition processes of frail older adults in order to identify the challenges within this process. A multi-phase, multi-sited and mixed methods design was utilized, in which, Phase 1 included collecting semi-structured interviews and focus group data, and Phase 2 consisted of six patient/caregiver dyad prospective case studies. This study was conducted in three hospitals in three cities in a single province in Canada. The Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) was employed to model daily operations of the transition process. The perspectives of both healthcare providers and patients/caregivers were used to build the FRAM model. The transition model was then tested using a customized version of the FRAM. The six patient/caregiver cases were used in the process of testing the FRAM model. The results of building the FRAM model showed that five categories of functions contributed to the transition model, including admission, assessment, synthesis, decision-making, and readmission. The outcomes of using the customized version of the FRAM revealed challenges affecting the transition process including waitlists for geriatric units, team-based care, lack of a discharge planner, financial concerns, and follow-up plans. The findings of this study could assist managers and other decision makers to improve the transition processes of frail older adults by addressing these challenges. The FRAM method employed in this study can be applied widely to identify work practices that are more or less successful, so that procedures and practices can be adapted to nudge healthcare processes towards paths that will yield better outcomes.","Transition process, Frail patients, Functional resonance analysis method (FRAM), Geriatric unit, Healthcare providers",Vahid Salehi and Natasha Hanson and Doug Smith and Rose McCloskey and Pamela Jarrett and Brian Veitch,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000399,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103392,0003-6870,2021,103392,93,Applied Ergonomics,Modeling and analyzing hospital to home transition processes of frail older adults using the functional resonance analysis method (FRAM),article,SALEHI2021103392
"The Ovako Working posture Assessment System (OWAS) is a commonly used observational assessment method for determining the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. OWAS claims to be suitable in the application for untrained persons but there is not enough evidence for this assumption. In this paper, inter-rater (inter-observer) reliability (agreement) is examined down to the level of individual postures and categories. For this purpose, the postures of 20 volunteers have been observed by 3 varying human raters in a laboratory setting and the inter-rater agreement against reference values was determined. A high agreement of over 98% (Îº=0.98) was found for the postures of the arms but lower agreements were found for posture classification of the legs (66â??97%,Îº=0.85) and the upper body (80â??96%,Îº=0.85). No significant difference was found between raters with and without intense prior training in physical therapy. Consequently, the results confirm the general reliability of the OWAS method especially for raters with non-specialized background but suggests weaknesses in the reliable detection of a few particular postures.","OWAS, Working postures, Risk assessment, Reliability analysis",Christian Lins and Sebastian Fudickar and Andreas Hein,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103357,0003-6870,2021,103357,93,Applied Ergonomics,OWAS inter-rater reliability,article,LINS2021103357

"Sustained non-neutral postures of the head/neck are related to transient neck discomfort and longer-term disorders of the neck. Periodic breaks can help but the ideal length and frequency of breaks are yet to be determined. The current study aimed to quantify the effects of three work-rest strategies on fatigue development. Participants maintained a 45-degree neck flexion posture for a total of 60Â min and were provided 3Â min of rest distributed in different ways throughout the experiment [LONG (one, 3-min break), MEDIUM (two, 1.5-min breaks), or SHORT (five, 36-s breaks)]. Surface electromyography data were collected from the bilateral neck extensors and trapezius. Subjective discomfort/fatigue ratings were also gathered. Results of the analysis of the EMG data revealed that the SHORT condition did not show increased EMG activity, while LONG [21%] and MEDIUM [10%] did (pÂ <Â 0.05), providing objective data supporting the guidance of short, frequent breaks to alleviate fatigue.","Work-rest cycle, Neck pain, Cervical spine, Electromyography, Musculoskeletal disorder",Pramiti Sarker and Hamid Norasi and Jordyn Koenig and M.

"Pedestrians rely on vehicle dynamics, engine sound, and driver cues. The lack of engine sound now constitutes an addressed pedestrian safety issue for (hybrid) electric vehicles ((H)EVs). Analogously, lacking driver cues may constitute a pedestrian safety issue for self-driving vehicles (SDVs). The purpose of this study was to systematically compare the relevance of substituting driver cues with an external human-machine interface among SDVs (no eHMI vs. eHMI) with the relevance of substituting engine sound with artificial sound among (H)EVs (no engine sound vs. engine sound). In a within-subject design, twenty-nine participants acting as pedestrians encountered a simulated SDV in a parking lot. The results revealed that both informational cues have equally large effects on subjective measures such as perceived safety. In semi-structured interviews, participants stated that it is equally crucial to equip SDVs with an eHMI as equipping (H)EVs with an artificial sound generator. We conclude that an eHMI for SDVs seems to be as relevant as an artificial sound for (H)EVs.","Self-driving vehicles, External human-machine interface, Engine sound",Stefanie M.

"It is important to understand how the hand and fingers elongate and contract with hand posture for optimally fitting and comfortable gloves. Nevertheless, the measurement and analysis of the finger segments for glove designs remain largely neglected. Here, the length and proportion of the finger segments when splayed and during gripping, and between the dorsal and palm sides of 30 participants are 3D scanned and analysed. The full digit lengths change by 7.6â??11.9% with hand posture, but the finger segment changes are not proportional. The ratios of the fingertip to distal interphalangeal joint/full digit, and fingertip to the proximal interphalangeal joint/full digit, are important variables. The results are validated with 10 more subjects based on ratings of a ready-to-wear sports glove. Inaccurate proportioning of the finger regions causes shifting which results in displacement and discomfort.

"Motion sickness (MS) is known to be a potentially limiting factor for future self-driving vehicles â?? specifically in regards to occupant comfort and well-being. With this as a consideration comes the desire to accurately measure, track and even predict MS state in real-time. Previous research has considered physiological measurements to measure MS state, although, this is mainly measured after an MS exposure and not throughout exposure(s) to a MS task. A unique contribution of this paper is in the real-time tracking of subjective MS alongside real-time physiological measurements of Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and skin temperature. Data was collected in both simulator-based (controlled) and on-road (naturalistic) studies. 40 participants provided at total of 61 data sets, providing 1603Â min of motion sickness data for analysis. This study is in agreement that these measures are related to MS but evidenced a total lack of reliability for these measures at an individual level for both simulator and on-road experimentation. It is likely that other factors, such as environment and emotional state are more impactful on these physiological measures than MS itself. At a cohort level, the applicability of physiological measures is not considered useful for measuring MS accurately or reliably in real-time. Recommendations for further research include a mixed-measures approach to capture other data types (such as subject activity) and to remove contamination of physiological measures from environmental changes.","Biometrics, Driver state monitoring, Human factors, Motion sickness, Physiology",Joseph Smyth and Stewart Birrell and Roger Woodman and Paul Jennings,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302635,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103315,0003-6870,2021,103315,92,Applied Ergonomics,Exploring the utility of EDA and skin temperature as individual physiological correlates of motion sickness,article,SMYTH2021103315
"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are common among manufacturing workers. Exposure to non-neutral postures and high movement speeds associated with MSDs among manufacturing workers may depend on the extent of the variability in the work tasks performed (i.e., predominantly â??cyclicâ? versus â??non-cyclicâ? work). The objectives of this study were to (i) compare mean levels of full-shift exposure summary metrics based on both posture and movement speed between manufacturing workers performing predominantly cyclic (nÂ =Â 18) and non-cyclic (nÂ =Â 17) tasks, and (ii) explore patterns of between- and within-worker exposure variance and between-minute (within-shift) exposure level and variation within each group.

Results indicated (i) substantially higher upper arm and trunk movement speeds among workers performing predominantly cyclic tasks relative to workers performing non-cyclic tasks despite similar postures, and (ii) greater exposure variability both between and within workers in the non-cyclic group.","Musculoskeletal disorders, Exposure variability, Inertial measurement unit, Posture, Low back, Shoulder",Mark C.

"Objective We examined the impact of increasing cognitive load on climbing performance and the impact of climbing on concurrent cognitive task performance. Background Generally when two tasks are performed simultaneously performance of one or both suffers relative to performance of each alone. Such dual task decrement is not confined to competing cognitive tasks, but has also been found when one task involves demanding physical activity. Method Skilled climbers performed a traverse climb alone and in combination with low and high cognitive load counting tasks, which were also performed alone. Results In more realistic physical settings, physical and cognitive tasks will interfere, unlike what some literature using laboratory physical tasks may indicate. Conclusion Compared to single task (climb only) performance concurrent counting and climbing resulted in impaired performance. However, climbers appeared to prioritize climbing over cognitive task performance. Application The results and this program of research have implications for occupations that involve concurrent demanding physical activity and cognitive task performance. PrÃ©cis High risk, physical tasks in real world conditions appear to hinder cognitive performance more so than low-risk physical tasks carried out in laboratory conditions.","Climbing, Dual task, Physical performance, Rock climbing, Tone counting",Megan J.

"Multiple errors can occur in a use-of-force scenario, although some critical errors involve unintended casualties where the target should never have been fired upon. Training instructors utilize a variety of methods to ensure military and law enforcement personnel do not inflict unintended casualties. However, there is little empirical evidence about the best methods to design a shooting simulation that might evoke these errors, which is critical to ensure the validity of any assessment or training exercise. The current study analyzed performance across a variety of simulated shooting scenarios developed and applied for military training purposes. Several factors were assessed based upon either the scenario or human performance. Scenario type, number of shots fired, and the ratio of hostiles-to-non-hostiles were significant predictors for the likelihood of inflicting an unintended casualty. This collected evidence should help improve scenario design for future training simulations that will help avoid these critical shooting errors.","Shooting, Lethal force, Simulation, Unintended casualties, Civilian casualties, Errors",Adam T.

"This study evaluated the potential mismatch between vacuum-sealed jar opening demands and wrist torque strength of 758 (384 males and 374 females) participants aged 5â??74 years in Iran. Wrist ulnar/radial (U/R) torque strength of participants and required torque for opening the existing jars (with 2 different sizes â?? 65Â mm and 85Â mm diameter lids) were measured using a digital angle torque adaptor and then compared together to identify any potential mismatch between them. The mismatch percentages were defined as the number of participants whose maximal wrist U/R torque strength were lower than the minimum required torque strength for opening the vacuum-sealed jars. Minimum required torque strength for opening the existing 65Â mm and 85Â mm vacuum-sealed jars were 4.1 Nm and 6.6 Nm, respectively (rangeÂ =Â 4.1 Nm to 10.2 Nm). A considerable mismatch (rangeÂ =Â 25%â??100%) was found between the required torque strength for opening the existing jars and the wrist U/R torque strength of the study population, particularly for females and those aged 5â??9 years.

"Within the last decade, Para sport has experienced increased growth, global popularity, and scientific research. Likewise, there is increasing application of systems ergonomics methods to optimise sports performance. Despite this, few studies have attempted to analyse Para sport as a complex system. The aim of this study was to apply a systems ergonomics framework to redesign a current Para sport system via a multi staged approach. The Cognitive Work Analysis framework was used to model and redesign the Para sport system, via the insertion of design interventions. The findings offer insights into the complexity of the Para sport system via the multiple interacting factors that influence the performance of the system. In addition, the design interventions had substantial influence on the Para sport system by creating multiple new processes, functions, measures, and purposes, and enhanced multiple components of the existing system. This study provides a unique contribution to ergonomic science and extends system ergonomics theory and methods in sport. This study has practical implications for policy development by providing a template that can be used by others wanting to optimise able-bodied sport, Para sport, and non-sport systems.","Para sport, Cognitive work analysis, Work domain analysis, System ergonomics, Complex systems",Scott McLean and Gemma JM.

"People visiting different Government Hospitals at Jabalpur in central India, were facing problems in comprehending different symbols. One of such hospital authority approached the research team for developing new symbols which could be easily comprehended by the users. Based on this, the current study was conducted, which included two experiments. The first experiment dealt with the ergonomic evaluation and identification of problems associated with the existing symbols. New concepts were then developed based on Ergonomic principles and usersâ?? feedback. The second experiment focused upon testing of the new concepts on the target users. Results of Experiment 1 indicated that the mean comprehension level was 22.3% for all the existing symbols (nÂ =Â 41). Low scores (on a scale of 1â??10) were found for the existing symbol for ergonomic principles (mean value was 1.9 for Compatibility, 2.1 for Familiarity, and 2.0 for Standardisation). Redesigned concepts of the symbols were tested on the target users, the result indicated an improvement in comprehensibility of newly designed symbols. The mean comprehension level for 53 new/redesigned symbols was 70.2%, which included redesign of 41 orignal and inclusion of 12 new symbols. High scores (on a scale of 1â??10) were received for all the new symbols for ergonomic principles (the mean value was 8.4 for Compatibility, 8.5 for Familiarity, and 8.5 for Standardisation).

"Introduction Failure-to-identify hunting incidents occur when a hunter, believing they are shooting at an animal, shoots at another human. Anecdotal evidence from the hunting community suggests that heightened arousal or excitement (â??buck feverâ?), liquid intake, food intake, sleepiness and personality factors may be contributory factors to such incidents. Hunters who have shot other people based on failures-to-identify also report observing their hunted quarry for a considerable time before discharging their firearm. Concerning the complexity of hunting, we sought to ascertain if simulation would prove an effective platform for future safety research into this phenomenon. Method We conducted a video-based simulation of a deer hunt during a hunting exhibition show. Participants (NÂ =Â 60) took part in one of four conditions â?? two types of scenario (having a good versus bad hunt) and two types of video (clear opportunity to shoot a stag versus clear opportunity to shoot an animal that cannot be identified). We investigated hunting outcomes and physiological arousal during the simulation, as well as personality traits, and self-reports of food, liquid intake and sleepiness. We also measured estimated versus actual time elapsed. Results Pupil dilation, consistent with psychophysiological arousal, occurred when the hunter spotted their first stag, whereas Electrodermal Activity reduced. In the 10Â s before shooting, EDA increased substantially. Time also appeared to slow down based on the participantsâ?? estimations of duration. Conclusions The findings corroborate suggestions of physiological arousal in the immediate lead-up to shooting but fall short of direct evidence for â??buck feverâ? contributing to target misidentification. The simulation appeared to provide enough immersion to facilitate future research. Practical application This helps to understand the psychophysiological and temporal considerations of a hunter as they decide to shoot based on the information available to them at the time.","Deer hunting, Decision making, Signal detection theory, Firearms, Physiology",K.E.

"A single sacrum mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU) was employed to analyze warfighter performance on a bounding rush (prone-sprinting-prone) task. Thirty-nine participants (23M/16F) performed a bounding rush task consisting of four bounding rush cycles. The sacrum mounted IMU recorded angular velocity and acceleration data were used to provide estimates of sacral velocity and position. Individual rush cycles were parsed into three principal movement phases; namely, the get up, sprint, and get down phases. The timing of each phase was analyzed, averaged for each participant, and compared to the overall rush cycle time using regression analysis. A cluster analysis further reveals differences between high and low performers. Get down time was most predictive of bounding rush performance (R2Â =Â 0.75) followed by get up time (R2Â =Â 0.58) and sprint time (R2Â =Â 0.40). Comparing high and low performers, the get down time exhibited nearly twice the effect on mean rush cycle time compared to get up time (effect size of â??2.61 to â??1.46, respectively). Overall, this IMU-based method reveals key features of the bounding rush that govern performance. Consequently, this objective method may support future training regimens and performance standards for military recruits, and parallel applications for athletes.","Bounding rush, Warfighter performance, Inertial measurement units, Biomechanics",Steven P.

An online survey, and in-depth interviews with a purposive sub-sample were conducted. A total of 216 eligible participants from 150 organisations across 18 sectors completed the survey with 17 interviews conducted. 40% of organisations provided SSWs on request while 41% reported not using them appropriately. Over half provided no training on the appropriate use of SSWs (nÂ =Â 109, 51%) nor used any strategies to enhance their use (nÂ =Â 163, 84%). From the interviews, SSWs were perceived effective in reducing discomforts and increasing employeesâ?? satisfaction and productivity.

"Activity-based workplaces (ABWs) are becoming popular in Western countries and were implemented at four office sites of a large Swedish government agency. A fifth office was used as a control group. The study aim was to examine the effects of relocation to ABW on perceived productivity among employees and to determine if perceived change-oriented leadership behavior prior to relocation moderates potential effects. Data were collected three months prior to relocation, and three and 12 months after. 407 respondents were included in linear mixed regression models. Perceived productivity decreased significantly after relocation compared to the control group and these effects persisted 12 months after the relocation. However, the decrease in perceived productivity was significantly smaller among employees perceiving high change-oriented leadership before relocation. Our results point out the importance of a change-oriented leadership behavior during the implementation to avoid productivity loss among employees when implementing ABWs.","Flexible office, Organisational change, Implementation process",Eva L.

"The introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) into urban areas initially leads to mixed traffic, consisting of AVs, human drivers, and vulnerable road users. Since the AV's passenger is no longer actively involved in the driving task, there may be changes in the interaction between AVs and surrounding human road users. Therefore, it is essential for an AV to behave in a comprehensible manner in order to maintain or even enhance traffic efficiency and traffic safety. This work investigates the interaction of an AV and a simultaneously oncoming human driver at road bottlenecks due to double-parked vehicles on both sides of the road. Based on findings derived from AV-pedestrian interaction, comfort limits in terms of driving dynamics, and traffic observations, we designed nine AV movements to either yield the right of way or to insist on it by varying the AV's speed (maintain speed, one-step deceleration, two-step deceleration) and its lateral offset (no offset, close offset, distant offset). The different vehicle movements were evaluated with 34 participants in a driving simulator study. The results show participants' shorter passing times, fewer crashes, and significantly higher ratings of the AV's communication if the AV movement contained a lateral offset. In addition to the regular encounters, we analyzed the controllability of an automation failure and its aftereffect on participants' trust in AVs. The experience of the automation failure reduced the trust rating significantly. From the results we conclude that the AV should communicate the right of way not only via speed adjustments but also via the performance of a lateral offset to enhance traffic efficiency and safety. Moreover, a change in the AV's maneuver due to an automation failure must be avoided since it is not controllable by the human driver.","Automated driving, Movement design, Implicit communication, Road bottleneck scenario",Michael Rettenmaier and Sabrina Dinkel and Klaus Bengler,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000855,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103438,0003-6870,2021,103438,95,Applied Ergonomics,Communication via motion â??

"The use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) for monitoring and classifying physical activities has received substantial attention in recent years, both in occupational and non-occupational contexts. However, a â??user-friendlyâ? approach is needed to promote this approach to quantify physical demands in actual workplaces. We explored the use of a single IMU for extracting information about different manual material handling (MMH) tasks (i.e., specific type of task performed, and associated duration and frequency), using a bidirectional long short-term memory network for classification. Classification performance using single IMUs placed on several body parts was compared with performance using multiple IMU configurations (2, 3, and 17 IMUs). Overall, the use of a single sensor led to satisfactory results (e.g., median accuracy >97%) in classifying MMH tasks and estimating task duration and frequency. Limited benefits were obtained using additional sensors, and several sensor locations yielded similar outcomes. Classification performance, though, was relatively inferior for push/pull vs. other tasks.","Manual material handling, Task classification, Exposure assessment",Micaela Porta and Sunwook Kim and Massimiliano Pau and Maury A.

"The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of three passive back-support exoskeletons (FLx ErgoSkeleton, V22 ErgoSkeleton, and Laevo V2.5) and patient transfer methods on physical demands in the low back and shoulders during patient transfer. Twenty professional caregivers (17 females and 3 males) performed a series of simulated patient transfer tasks between a wheelchair and a bed with three different patient transfer methods including the squat pivot, stand pivot, and scoot with two directions (wheelchair to bed and vice versa). The passive exoskeletons (FLx ErgoSkeleton, V22 ErgoSkeleton, and Laevo V2.5) significantly affected trunk postures (forward flexion and lateral flexion), shoulder postures (flexion and abduction), hand pull forces, muscle activities of erector spinae and middle deltoid (p-valuesÂ <Â 0.01). The muscle activities of the erector spinae were significantly lower (up to 11.2%) with the FLx and V22 ErgoSkeletons compared to no exoskeleton condition (p-valuesÂ <Â 0.002). However, the trunk and shoulder flexion angles with the passive exoskeleton use were greater (up to 77.3%) than those without the exoskeletons (p-valuesÂ <Â 0.03). The biomechanical benefits and usability varied by passive exoskeleton designs (p-valuesÂ <Â 0.01). The lower muscle activities of the erector spinae suggest that the back-support exoskeletons may be a viable intervention to reduce the low back strain during patient transfer tasks. More research would be needed to reduce the adverse effects of back-support exoskeletons on the postures such as increased trunk and shoulder flexions during patient handling.","Patient handling, Healthcare ergonomics, Electromyography, Hand pull force, Musculoskeletal disorders, Low back demand",Jaejin Hwang and Venkata Naveen {Kumar Yerriboina} and Hemateja Ari and Jeong Ho Kim,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702100020X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103373,0003-6870,2021,103373,93,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of passive back-support exoskeletons on physical demands and usability during patient transfer tasks,article,HWANG2021103373

"External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) may be useful for communicating the intention of an automated vehicle (AV) to a pedestrian, but it is unclear which eHMI design is most effective. In a crowdsourced experiment, we examined the effects of (1) colour (red, green, cyan), (2) position (roof, bumper, windshield), (3) message (WALK, DONâ??T WALK, WILL STOP, WONâ??T STOP, light bar), (4) activation distance (35 or 50Â m from the pedestrian), and (5) the presence of visual distraction in the environment, on pedestrians' perceived safety of crossing the road in front of yielding and non-yielding AVs. Participants (NÂ =Â 1434) had to press a key when they felt safe to cross while watching a random 40 out of 276 videos of an approaching AV with eHMI. Results showed that (1) green and cyan eHMIs led to higher perceived safety of crossing than red eHMIs; no significant difference was found between green and cyan, (2) eHMIs on the bumper and roof were more effective than eHMIs on the windshield, (3) for yielding AVs, perceived safety was higher for WALK compared to WILL STOP, followed by the light bar; for non-yielding AVs, a red bar yielded similar results to red text, (4) for yielding AVs, a red bar caused lower perceived safety when activated early compared to late, whereas green/cyan WALK led to higher perceived safety when activated late compared to early, and (5) distraction had no significant effect. We conclude that people adopt an egocentric perspective, that the windshield is an ineffective position, that the often-recommended colour cyan may have to be avoided, and that eHMI activation distance has intricate effects related to onset saliency.","Automated driving, eHMI, Crowdsourcing, Distraction, Pedestrian safety",P.

Additionally, the driver had to solve a non-driving-related task (NDRT) which was an auditory cognitive, spatial task. Results showed that while driving with the AR display, participants performed better in the NDRT, which indicates a reduced mental load compared with the HUD.

"During pregnancy, anthropometric and physiological changes can result in difficulty reaching for and lifting everyday objects. The aims of this study were to determine the changes in sagittal plane anterior reach space (SPARS) and shoulder/elbow strength requirements throughout pregnancy. Seventeen participants were tested through a longitudinal observational cohort study between 16 and 36 weeks gestation in four-week intervals. A 25% decrease in SPARS was observed at the L3-4 torso height. Combined with arm mass increases, shoulder and elbow moment requirements at the minimum and maximum static reach distances significantly increased. However, inverse dynamics analysis determined that mass gains in the arm alone only minimally impact dynamic shoulder moments. Additionally, torso flexion increases throughout pregnancy demonstrates that women are attempting to compensate for decreased SPARS, possibly indicating the additional perceptual importance of reach space in accommodations for pregnant workers.","Pregnancy, Reach, Shoulder",Chantel B.

"Purpose To investigate the influence of aerobic capacity, muscle strength, and body composition on performance and metabolic demands of men wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Methods 45 men were assigned to one of four groups which significantly differed in upright pull isometric strength (MVCÂ â?¤Â 1325Â N orÂ â?¥Â 1531Â N) and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2maxÂ â?¤Â 51.9Â mLÂ minâ??1Â·kgâ??1 orÂ â?¥Â 56.0Â mLÂ minâ??1Â·kgâ??1): endurance-trained (low MVC, high VO2max), strength-trained (high MVC, low VO2max), endurance- and strength-trained (high MVC, high VO2max), and untrained (low MVC, low VO2max). Each participant underwent two test series consisting of a repeated 10Â m dummy drag and a graded exercise test wearing either sportswear or PPE of a German riot police unit weighing 20.9Â kg (statistics: two-way repeated measures ANOVA, stepwise multiple linear regressions). Results With PPE, dummy drag and running performance were impaired by 14Â Â±Â 9% and 58Â Â±Â 7%. Groups with high MVC dragged the dummy significantly faster than groups with low MVC (17.5Â Â±Â 1.8Â s/17.6Â Â±Â 1.4Â s vs. 23.4Â Â±Â 5.6Â s/22.3Â Â±Â 3.5Â s). Running distance was significantly higher in groups with high VO2max (4.5Â Â±Â 0.8 km/4.4Â Â±Â 0.7Â km vs. 3.1Â Â±Â 0.5 km/2.8Â Â±Â 0.5Â km). Body composition variables partially correlated with performance (R ranging from â??0.70 to 0.41), but were not significant predictors of the regression models in PPE. Conclusions Individuals who showed a certain degree of aerobic endurance, as well as muscle strength, performed consistently well during the test series. Therefore, none of these variables should be trained in isolation but optimized in combination to be capable in a variety of operational tasks.","Body armor, Load carriage, Tactical occupations",Lukas Zwingmann and Marco Hoppstock and Jan-Peter Goldmann and Patrick Wahl,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000181,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103371,0003-6870,2021,103371,93,Applied Ergonomics,The effect of physical training modality on exercise performance with police-related personal protective equipment,article,ZWINGMANN2021103371
"Archived video footage from a previous task analysis study where children attempted to open prescription vials outfitted with 42Â mm (diameter) push and turn closures was reviewed and grip postures were characterized based on a grip taxonomy presented by Rowson & Yoxall which investigated adult grips (2011). Video review was conducted to identify the types of grip postures children aged 3â??5 years utilized when attempting to open continuous thread polypropylene vials outfitted with push and turn, child-resistant closures and compared with grip postures identified with the adults. Children tended to utilize only 3 grip postures (spherical, cylindrical, and pronated cylindrical grips), while adults utilized seven different postures. If children utilize a more limited set of grip postures when opening child resistant closures than their adult counterparts, this difference could be exploited when designing child resistant packaging systems. That said, our study utilized a limited number of CRC designs and confounds existed between the package sizes the children in the archived video footage attempted to open and those that served as the point of comparison which identified grip postures utilized by adults. As such, further investigation is needed across a range of package diameters. Potential implications for child-resistant packaging design are discussed.","Child-resistant packaging, Openability, Grip postures",Cory J.

"This study performed a direct comparison between empirically measured female linear arm strengths and those estimated with the 3D Static Strength Prediction Program (3DSSPP). Linear arm strengths were collected from 15 female participants, at four hand locations and six primary directions (nÂ =Â 360), and then estimated with 3DSSPP incorporating each participant's own segment lengths, body masses and joint strengths, and the measured arm postures from each trial to optimize the accuracy of 3DSSPP. In spite of this, the errors in 3DSSPP's estimated arm strength values were very high (RMS errorÂ =Â 56.0Â N and 40.4%) and poorly correlated (r2Â =Â 29.2%) with measured strengths. These results seriously question the accuracy of 3DSSPP to estimate female linear arm strengths and percent capable values, for the range of conditions tested, likely due to the overly simplified assumptions made to estimate triaxial shoulder strength.","Physical ergonomics, Occupational biomechanics, Task assessment",Andrew D.

"Fatigue arising from excessive work demands is a known safety challenge in hospital nurses. This study aimed to determine which measures of work demands during nursing work are most predictive of hospital nurse fatigue levels at the end of the work shift. Measures of work demands of registered nurses from two hospital units in the United States were collected from organizational data sources, wearable sensors, and questionnaires. Fatigue levels were measured at the start and end of each shift using the Brief Fatigue Inventory. Multilevel linear regression analysis was used to predict end of shift fatigue based on work demand variables. The best fit model included multiple variables from organizational data sources and a physical activity variable measured by a wearable sensor. Organizational data can be used to create dynamic measures of work demands as they occur and predict end of shift fatigue levels in hospital nurses.","Fatigue, Nurses, Work demands",Sarah L.

"Chronotype refers to individual differences in the timing of circadian sleep-wake cycles and subjective alertness throughout the day. It is a potential factor influencing people's driving behaviour, but no research has explored the mechanisms underlying this topic. The current study aimed to explore the relationship between morningness-eveningness preferences and driving behaviour and the mediating effect of visual search between them. Thirty-eight drivers were selected to participate in this study based on their chronotype. They were divided into morning-type and evening-type groups by their score on the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ). Both groups completed a visual search task and a simulated driving task in a morning session and an evening session. The results showed that morningness-eveningness preferences had synchronous effects on basic driving performance; specifically, morning-type drivers showed better driving behaviour in the morning than in the evening, and evening-type drivers showed the opposite trend. Furthermore, visual search abilities showed a mediating effect between morningness-eveningness preference and driving performance. The mechanisms underlying these results are discussed. Related results and data could aid with schedule arrangements for professional drivers.","Chronotype, Synchronous effect, Driving performance, Visual search",Yan Ge and Yuchen Wang and Yuexin Xiong and Weina Qu,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302611,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103313,0003-6870,2021,103313,92,Applied Ergonomics,Does visual search mediate the effect of chronotype on driving behaviour: Evidence from simulated driving,article,GE2021103313
"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is one of the most frequently occurring musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limbs. Strategies for preventing CTS in the workplace include interventions such as ergonomics, education, exercise, physical therapy, and occupational health. The purpose of this study was to provide a general overview based on the review of scientific literature regarding strategies used for preventing CTS in working populations. From September to October 2018, the MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE and SCOPUS (1990 to December 2017) databases were searched for evidence. The risk of bias assessment in the selected papers was evaluated using the criteria recommended by The Cochrane Handbook and the methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields. A total of 11 studies were included in the present review. A total of 1,061 subjects participated in the studies. The quality of the included studies was limited in three studies, appropriate in three studies, good in three studies, and strong in two studies. The overall results suggest a mixed level of evidence of the effect of applying strategies for preventing CTS in the workplace. The bias assessment was primarily due to incomplete result data, selective reporting of results, and blinding. In this review, interventions focused on the modification or change of accessories (keyboard, mouse, wrist rest, and the overall workstation), education in ergonomics, exercise, and physical therapies, among others, were analyzed. The findings of this review show different possibilities when choosing an intervention strategy for the workplace. However, it was challenging to analyze each of the papers owing to the heterogeneity of the studies included.","Carpal tunnel syndrome, Primary and secondary prevention, Workplace",MarÃ­a-Constanza Trillos-ChacÃ³n and Juan A.

"Objective Identify whether contextual information may unintentionally alter decision-making during lethal force training. Background Lethal force decisions inherently involve a threat assessment, where an individual learns to identify a threat and use force commensurate to the situation. This decision is ultimately subject to numerous cognitive influences, particularly during training where artificial factors may bias decision-making. Method Participants made threat assessments for tasks that presented hostile stimuli (pointing guns) and non-hostile stimuli (holding cell phones). Experiment 1 identified issues in target design by applying scoring rings as cues to targets, whereas Experiment 2 used bullet holes to assess cues due to target reuse. Experiment 3 applied these cues equally to hostile and non-hostile stimuli to prevent a predictive relationship from forming. Results Significant cueing effects were observed in both Experiments 1 and 2. For Experiment 3, response times were not impacted by the invalid cues as participants could no longer reliably use the cue to distinguish between hostile and non-hostile stimuli. Conclusion Stimulus-related factors can unintentionally create predictive relationships during lethal force training. These predictive factors are problematic because they allow participants to make threat assessments during training in a way that would never be realistic in the field. Application Modifications should be made to hostile and non-hostile targets in equal measure to avoid creating an unintentionally predictive relationship that identifies hostile targets. In practice, scoring rings and bullet holes should be added to non-hostile stimuli to better parallel hostile stimuli.","Cue, Lethal force, Training, Threat assessment, Military, Law enforcement, Shoot/don't-shoot",Adam T.

"Instantaneous consumption displays (ICDs) can be used as central information source to perceive the energy efficiency of manoeuvre-level driving. A key question is whether drivers who use ICDs can accurately derive energy efficiency differences of different driving strategies based on ICDs. There is reason to assume that drivers' consumption judgements may be biased, similar to driving-related phenomena like the time-saving bias. Therefore, the aim of the present research was to examine driversâ?? accuracy in deriving average consumption from dynamic ICD sequences. Participants viewed videos of a schematic ICD in a controlled experiment where the maximum instantaneous consumption systematically varied over time. Participants (NÂ =Â 55) overestimated the average consumption values. The empirical ranking of the sequences did significantly correlate with the heuristic but not with the correct efficiency ranking. The current study incorporated multilevel modelling due to the nested structure of the data. The estimation difference was greater with higher peak height and shorter peak duration. The effect of peak height on estimation difference weakened with longer peak duration. In sum, the results indicate that ICDs can create biased perceptions of energy efficiency and that drivers seem to use simplifying heuristics. Knowledge and affinity for technology interaction appear to relate to biased estimations, whereas the intensity of prior experience with consumption displays seems irrelevant. Further studies should test other interfaces with debiasing potential such as manoeuvre-based aggregation or fading-trace approaches. Moreover, studies are needed that enable modelling of the effects of more natural temporal-spatial visual attention distribution (e.g. in a driving simulator setting).","Biased perception, Heuristics, Instantaneous consumption displays, Data visualisation, Energy efficiency",Vivien Esther Moll and Thomas Franke,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000466,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103399,0003-6870,2021,103399,94,Applied Ergonomics,Biased energy efficiency perception based on instantaneous consumption displays â??

Workers often develop low back pain due to manually lifting heavy loads. Instrumental-based assessment tools are used to quantitatively assess the biomechanical risk in lifting activities. This study aims to verify the hypothesis that high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) allows an optimized discrimination of risk levels associated with different fatiguing lifting conditions compared to traditional bipolar sEMG. 15 participants performed three lifting tasks with a progressively increasing lifting index (LI) each lasting 15Â min. Erector spinae (ES) activity was recorded using both bipolar and HDsEMG systems. The amplitude of both bipolar and HDsEMG can significantly discriminate each pair of LI. HDsEMG data could discriminate across the different LIs starting from the fourth minute of the task while bipolar sEMG could only do so towards the end. The higher discriminative power of HDsEMG data across the lifting tasks makes such methodology a valuable tool to be used to monitor fatigue while lifting and could extend the possibilities offered by currently available instrumental-based tools.,"Bipolar and high-Density (HD) sEMG, Biomechanical risk, Fatiguing frequency-dependent lifting activities",Tiwana Varrecchia and Alberto Ranavolo and Silvia Conforto and Alessandro Marco {De Nunzio} and Michail Arvanitidis and Francesco Draicchio and Deborah Falla,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103456,0003-6870,2021,103456,95,Applied Ergonomics,Bipolar versus high-density surface electromyography for evaluating risk in fatiguing frequency-dependent lifting activities,article,VARRECCHIA2021103456
"Profile of cybersickness and balance disturbance induced by virtual ship motion alone and in combination with galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) remained unclear. Subjects were exposed to a ship deck vision scene under simulated Degree 5 or 3 sea condition using a head-mounted virtual reality display with or without GVS. Virtual ship motion at Degree 5 induced significant cybersickness with symptom profile: nausea syndromeÂ >Â central (headache and dizziness)Â >Â peripheral (cold sweating)Â >Â increased salivation. During a single session of virtual ship motion exposure, GVS aggravated balance disturbance but did not affect most cybersickness symptoms except cold sweating. Repeated exposure induced cybersickness habituation which was delayed by GVS, while the temporal change of balance disturbance was unaffected. These results suggested that vestibular inputs play different roles in cybersickness and balance disturbance during virtual reality exposure. GVS might not serve as a potential countermeasure against cybersickness induced by virtual ship motion.","Virtual ship motion, Galvanic vestibular stimulation, Cybersickness, Balance disturbance",Rui-Rui Qi and Shui-Feng Xiao and Lei-Lei Pan and Yu-Qi Mao and Yang Su and Lin-Jie Wang and Yi-Ling Cai,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702030260X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103312,0003-6870,2021,103312,92,Applied Ergonomics,Profiling of cybersickness and balance disturbance induced by virtual ship motion immersion combined with galvanic vestibular stimulation,article,QI2021103312
"The past decade has seen increasing popularity of large display-based freehand interaction. This study examined the effects of body posture, interaction distance and target size on freehand interaction with a large display. Participants performed pointing and dragging tasks by freehand interaction with a large display under sitting and standing postures and at different interaction distances. Targets in both small and large sizes were examined. Results showed that interaction distance yielded a significant effect on error rate, but the effect differed by task type. Little measurable difference was found in interaction performance, perceived usability and workload between sitting and standing postures. There were significant interaction effects between posture and interaction distance on perceived workload. Larger target size led to higher efficiency and accuracy in pointing tasks, but reduced accuracy in dragging tasks. This study provided implications that are likely to improve the design and deployment of large display-based freehand interaction techniques.","Freehand interaction, Large displays, Body posture, Interaction distance",Da Tao and Xiaofeng Diao and Tieyan Wang and Jingya Guo and Xingda Qu,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702100017X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103370,0003-6870,2021,103370,93,Applied Ergonomics,"Freehand interaction with large displays: Effects of body posture, interaction distance and target size on task performance, perceived usability and workload",article,TAO2021103370
"This study adapted the Demand Resource Evaluation Scores (DRES) as a metacognitive indicator in assessing pilot studentsâ?? perceptions during simulated training of a novel maneuver. Typically, positive DRES are associated with perceiving a demanding situation as a challenge and with improved performance, while negative DRES are linked to a perception of the situation as a threat, and to poorer performance. The novelty here was to assess DRES before and after the task and across three missions. Overall, students were found to change their perceptions from threat to challenge over time. Also, increased DRES were positively correlated with performance progressing from mission to mission, indicating that the students reflect on their performance as they advance in their training. These findings show that individual metacognitive evaluations of a stressful aviation maneuver might be important for the progress in performance.

"Reducing errors within a healthcare setting remains high on the patient safety research agenda. More consistent performance has been sought by increased development of standardised operating procedures, but they are not always adhered to in practice. Previous studies have identified that a difference exists between the way a task is imagined to be completed, based on standardised protocols and procedures, and how the task is actually completed in reality. This study explores one area of healthcare, community pharmacy, and more specifically the task of dispensing medicines from prescriptions, to identify the gap between how dispensing is imagined to be completed through standardised operating procedures, and how it is actually completed in practice, by using Hierarchical Task Analysis as a framework. Document analysis of standardised operating procedures in 3 community pharmacies was used to produce 3 task analyses, which were compared with 3 task analyses produced from data collected through non-participant observations of the same 3 community pharmacies. Deviations between the two forms of task analyses were presented to community pharmacists in focus group discussions and it was found staff may deviate from standardised protocols because of various reasons, including: efficiency; availability of resources; thoroughness; and delegating safeguards. Potential implications for the work system include the benefit of greater collaboration between procedure writers and frontline workers, and the introduction of more flexible procedures, that allow the risks of any adaptions to be clearly realised. Further work must establish whether pharmacists recognise the safety implications of these gaps between work as imagined, and work as done, and initiatives should be established to ensure patient safety is not compromised due to these differences.","Work-as-done, Work-as-imagined, Protocols, Organisational resilience, Pharmacy",Ahmed Ashour and Darren M.

"Minimal footwear has become more ubiquitous; however, it may increase slip severity. This study specifically examined the slipping kinematics of flip-flop sandals. Invoked slips from standing were evaluated in dry and wet tile, and a unique wet footbedÂ +Â wet tile condition, with 40, 50, and 60% bodyweight (BW) committed to the slipping foot. Water did not alter peak slip velocity (PV) at 40% BW, but PV increased with greater slip-foot force on wet tile by ~1Â m/s. Interestingly, when floor-contact was lost during the slip, the flip-flops could come off the heel. This decoupling occurred most often when both the tile and footbed were either dry or wet. Given that both decoupling and greater PV were observed on wet tile, slipping in flip-flops under wet conditions may have more serious consequences. The results highlight that slips may occur at both the footâ??flip-flop, and flip-flopâ??tile interfaces.","Slipping, Flip-flop sandal, Minimal footwear",Liana M. Tennant and Donna J.

"Automated vehicles are expected to enhance driving safety and comfort. In order to fulfil these expectations, they have to be widely accepted and used. Implementing an acceptable driving style is therefore a must. Previous research on automated vehicle acceptance has largely concentrated on the effects of driving dynamics. This study takes a different approach and focuses on the effects of the driving decisions. To assess the effects of driving decisions on acceptance, an online experimental study was conducted in China, Germany, Japan and the US. Four overtaking scenarios, in which the automated vehicle took a decision, were presented as short texts. The situations differed with regard to the action (overtaking vs. stay in lane) and potential consequence (high or low hindrance of another driver). Participants then rated their acceptance. The results indicate that acceptance is dependent on the driving decisions and is further influenced by cultural background. Chinese drivers show high acceptance to the decisions and there were no significant differences between the presented scenarios. In the US and Germany, decisions leading to high hindrance of others are rejected, whereas in cases of low hindrance, overtaking is preferred. Japanese participants reject decisions, which lead to hindrance of others.","Automated driving, Cross-culture, User acceptance, Decision-making",Aaron Edelmann and Stefan StÃ¼mper and Tibor Petzoldt,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302945,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103346,0003-6870,2021,103346,92,Applied Ergonomics,Cross-cultural differences in the acceptance of decisions of automated vehicles,article,EDELMANN2021103346
"Patient handling related musculoskeletal injuries are prevalent among Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers. The first step in many patient handling situations is where a supine patient on the floor is brought to a sitting position. This study investigated whether a strap, placed under the patient's torso and long enough that EMS providers can perform the patient raising task in a standing posture, reduced muscular effort. Fifteen participants raised a simulated patient, with the help of an assistant, using the strap method and a traditional method (grasping the shoulders) in an open area, a restricted space, and in a bathtub. Torso postures improved in all location conditions when using the strap. The muscle activation data showed mixed results. While EMG responses from the latissimus dorsi muscles were reduced, EMG activity of the erector spinae muscles increased when the strap was used. Perceived effort assessments supported the use of the strap.","Firefighter, EMS, Ergonomics, Intervention, Patient handling, Injury prevention",Yilun Xu and Steven A. Lavender and Carolyn M.

"A key challenge for designers of healthcare public reports is the development of a presentation format that accurately communicates the variability in the quality of care among healthcare systems. This study conducted in the United States explored whether presenting public report information within narratives and with tests of healthcare quality metrics supported the public report sensemaking process. The study involved 200 participants and employed a 2 (public report information presented in the standard format, presented within a narrative) * 2 (no tests of quality metrics added to standard report, metrics tests added) between-subjects experimental design. The participants viewed the scenario of a patient looking for dialysis facility-related information. They were then asked which dialysis facility they would choose for their care and their level of confidence in their choice. Subsequently, a knowledge quiz evaluating how the participants interpreted the information presented to them, the NASA-TLX workload survey, and a usability questionnaire were administered. The results showed that the probability of choosing the better facility from the perspective of the quality measures included in the report changed from 0.69 to 0.89 when information was presented within a narrative rather than with the standard public report format. The results also found a significantly higher comprehension score (MÂ =Â 54.58, SDÂ =Â 18.51) when information was presented within the narrative than when presented in the standard public report format (MÂ =Â 44.57, SDÂ =Â 25.13). When information was presented to the participants within a narrative, the narrative may have enabled the participants to visualize themselves as the person depicted in the narrative and this may have increased the perceived relevance of the quality measures. Total workload, mental demand and perceived usability were higher when information was presented within the narrative than when presented in the standard format. The high workload and mental demand may be due to the stress placed on the information processing channels while reading a narrative and the effort expended to relate it to the quality measures. They may also be markers of more deliberative decision making facilitated by the narratives. No significant effect of tests of quality metrics was found on the dependent variables of choice of the better healthcare facility, comprehension, and usability. There was also no significant effect of quality metrics tests on overall workload. However, the effect of quality metrics tests on the mental demand subscale of NASA-TLX was significant. Mental demand was higher without quality metrics tests than with quality metrics tests. No significant interaction was found between the two independent variables on the dependent variables of choice of the better healthcare facility, comprehension, workload, and usability. It is recommended that narratives be used to present public report information to support informed healthcare decisions.","Healthcare public reports, Comprehension, User interface design, Usability",Kapil {Chalil Madathil} and Joel S.

"In immersive virtual reality (VR) environments, users rely on the vision channel to search for objects. Such eyes-engaged interactive techniques may significantly degrade the interaction efficiency and user experience, particularly when users have to turn their head frequently to search for a target object in the limited field of view (FOV) of a head-mounted display (HMD). In this study, we systematically investigated user capabilities in eyes-free spatial target acquisition considering different horizontal angles, vertical angles, distances from the user's body, and body sides. Our results show that high acquisition accuracy and low task load are achieved for target locations at front and middle horizontal angles as well as those at middle vertical angles. Meanwhile, a trade-off cannot be achieved between the acquisition accuracy and the task load for target locations at long distances from the user's body. In addition, the acquisition accuracy and task load for the target locations vary with the body side. Our research findings can provide a deeper understanding of user capability in eyes-free target acquisition and offer concrete design guidelines for appropriate target arrangement for eyes-free target acquisition in immersive VR environments.","Virtual reality, Target acquisition, Eyes-free interaction",Huiyue Wu and Yanyi Deng and Jiajun Pan and Tianxing Han and Yonglin Hu and Kaini Huang and Xiaolong (Luke) Zhang,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000478,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103400,0003-6870,2021,103400,94,Applied Ergonomics,User capabilities in eyes-free spatial target acquisition in immersive virtual reality environments,article,WU2021103400
"Fatigue is a critically important aspect of crew endurance in submarine operations, with continuously high fatigue being associated with increased risk of human error and long-term negative health ramifications. Submarines pose several unique challenges to fatigue mitigation, including requirements for continuous manning for long durations, a lack of access to critical environmental zeitgebers (stimuli pertinent to circadian physiology; e.g., natural sunlight), and work, rest and sleep occurring within an encapsulated environment. In this paper, we examine the factors that underlie fatigue in such a context with the aim of evaluating the predictive utility of a biomathematical model (BMM) of fatigue. Three experience sampling studies were conducted with submarine crews using a participant-led measurement protocol that included assessments of subjective sleepiness, workload (NASA-Task Load Index [TLX] and a bespoke underload-overload scale), and sleep. As expected, results indicated that predicting KSS with a BMM approach outperformed more conventional linear modelling approaches (e.g., time-of-day, sleep duration, time awake). Both the homeostatic and circadian components of the BMM were significantly associated with KSS and used as controls in the workload models. We found increased NASA-TLX workload was significantly associated with increased average KSS ratings at the between-person level. However, counter to expectations, the two workload measures were not found to have significant linear or quadratic relationship with fatigue at the within-person level. An important outcome of the research is that applied fatigue researchers should be extremely cautious applying conventional linear predictors when predicting fatigue. Practical implications for the submarine and related extreme work context are discussed. Important avenues for continued research are outlined, including directly estimating BMM parameters.","Fatigue, Mental workload, Extreme work environment, Sleep, Experience sampling methodology, Biomathematical modelling, Human performance",Micah K.

"Manual patient handling tasks put formal and informal caregivers at risk of musculoskeletal injury. Intervention research to reduce risks to informal caregivers is limited. This study examined effects of slide sheet use when individual informal caregivers performed patient boosting and turning tasks. Three methods of slide sheet use and a baseline method (no slide sheet) were compared, to reposition a 70Â kg individual. Muscle activity, ground reaction force, posture, and rating of perceived exertion were significantly affected by task method. Erector Spinae activity was reduced in boosting and turning away tasks with the slide sheet. Shoulder elevation, torso angle, and normalized vertical ground reaction force were also reduced with the slide sheet during boosting. The turn towards task was generally not improved with the slide sheet. Overall, using a slide sheet provided biomechanical benefits to individual caregivers performing two common patient handling tasks: boosting and turning patient away from caregiver.","Musculoskeletal injury, Informal caregiver, Patient handling, Lumbar spine",Noura {Amini Pay} and Carolyn M.

"The introduction of Industry 4.0-enabling digital technologies in industrial work systems are creating various sociotechnical challenges affecting overall system performance and human well-being. In this paper, we propose a framework for (re)designing industrial work systems in the transition towards Industry 4.0. The framework combines human factors and ergonomics, work system modeling, and strategy design. It accommodates implementation challenges we have identified through ten retrospective case studies. In addition, we present the systematic approach applied to developing and testing the framework. Lastly, the framework was tested in a collaborative workshop in an industrial company, and the results indicated its applicability.","Cyber-physical systems, Digital transformation, Digital factory, Digitalization, Operator 4.0",Bzhwen A.

"Post-operative delirium (POD) is a health hazard condition for the patients and it is associated with increased costs for the healthcare system. Following a system-theoretic approach, firstly a model, then a questionnaire, have been designed to probe the collective awareness about POD throughout the entire patient's perioperative pathway. The 58 reported answers pointed out that most of the information, specifically associated with POD, are routinely recorded but not used to stratify the patients' individual risk to develop POD. The results suggest the need for design a new socio-technical role within modern health care systems: the POD analyst. A Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) model is proposed both to propel the awareness about POD and as a template for future POD risk factors collections.","STAMP, RiskSOAP, Team awareness",Andrea Falegnami and Riccardo Patriarca and Francesco Costantino and Giulio {Di Gravio} and Federico Bilotta,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302957,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103347,0003-6870,2021,103347,92,Applied Ergonomics,Surveying work-as-done in post-operative delirium risk factors collection and diagnosis monitoring,article,FALEGNAMI2021103347
"The road environment has changed markedly over the years. Train horns are ostensibly used to alert road users and are typically mandatory on approach to railway level crossings. However, they have increasingly been seen as a nuisance. Beyond their negative aspects, a study has yet to comprehensively evaluate train horn effectiveness and understand if they remain beneficial and relevant in the contemporary environment. Hence, this study aimed to provide evidence on the actual use of train horns. Field observations were conducted at 54 railway crossings across four Australian States. The effects of level crossing type, location, and environmental conditions were investigated in relation to train horn loudness as objectively measured at the crossing. Results revealed that train horns were not always used, presenting an issue for passive level crossings. However, when sounded, train horn use was redundant and insufficiently loud at level crossings equipped with bells. Taken together, current train horn practice was found to be highly variable and dependent on crossing type, remoteness, and individual train drivers, thus resulting in inconsistent warnings and raising important implications for standardisation.","Rail, Road, Safety, Noise, Loudness, Crossing, Standards",GrÃ©goire S.

"Eye movements as the indicators of human information processing have been studied in many domains. However, it is not clear how usersâ?? eye movements differ among specific product attribute, while visual impression of a product plays a crucial part in distinguishing product designs. Therefore, this paper attempts to establish guidance for exploring eye tracking applications in design concept validations through two case studies. The first case study investigated the product attributes based on the theory of cognitive-affective emotions. The second investigated the product attributes for apparent functionality and affective quality. The eye movements of 105 participants were analyzed when they evaluated the products images. The results indicated that product attributes perceived in evaluation tasks can be predicted from eye movements. Moreover, compared to the new users, experienced users had a longer mean fixation duration and tended to form their impressions of the product from multiple components.","Eye tracking, Product design evaluation, Users' perception",Jo-Yu Kuo and Chun-Hsien Chen and Shinichi Koyama and Danni Chang,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000405,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103393,0003-6870,2021,103393,94,Applied Ergonomics,Investigating the relationship between users' eye movements and perceived product attributes in design concept evaluation,article,KUO2021103393
"Seasonal work is characterized by difficult working conditions further influenced by organizational, physical, and time constraints which expose seasonal workers to high risks of MSDs. Our aim was to provide an overview of the recommendations and interventions carried out in a seasonal work context to prevent MSDs. To do this, we conducted a scoping review through a systematic electronic search of seven scientific databases and the websites of ergonomics and occupational health and safety organizations. After screening by independent reviewers according to specific criteria sets, we performed qualitative analyses on the 16 studies retained. Findings revealed six categories of transformation targets sought by the interventions/recommendations with the technical devices/physical work environment category being the most reported. We also found it was quite rare for studies to consider the seasonal work context in and of itself when developing and implementing interventions. Our review thus highlights the need to pay attention to intervention processes in order to better understand the influence of seasonality on the measures taken to prevent MSDs in working environments.","Seasonal work, Musculoskeletal disorders, Review studies, Occupational health and safety, Intervention",Marie-Eve Major and HÃ©lÃ¨ne Clabault and Pascal Wild,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000648,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103417,0003-6870,2021,103417,94,Applied Ergonomics,Interventions for the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders in a seasonal work context: A scoping review,article,MAJOR2021103417

"This study compared ground reaction forces (GRF) and lower limb two-dimensional (2D) kinematic waveforms, with and without load carriage, in military personnel walking in two different types of boots. Data were measured in 24-soldiers walking on a 10-m walkway under four randomized crossover trials: wearing two military boots (styrene-butadiene rubber midsole â?? SBR â?? 63 Shore A; and polyurethane midsole â?? PU â?? 48 Shore A); with and without a 15-kg backpack. GRF traditional parameters were evaluated by two-way ANOVAs. GRF and kinematic waveforms were assessed using a statistical parametric mapping (SPM) method (two-way ANOVA). No interaction effects were observed between footwear and load. GRF at the beginning of stance was lower while wearing the SBR boot condition compared to the PU boot condition. Load carriage increased trunk, hip, and knee flexion. The analyzed military boots did not affect movement patterns during loaded walking and the military boot with SBR midsole material reduced impact to a greater extent. The study demonstrated that the design and materials (e.g., midsole material and thickness) used in boot manufacturing can influence military boot performance.","Military footwear, Load carriage, Walking, Working boots",Adriane {Mara de Souza Muniz} and Douglas Sizenando and Gabriel Lobo and Eduardo Borba Neves and Michel GonÃ§alves and Runer Marson and Rudnei Palhano and Luciano Menegaldo and Rodrigo Rico Bini,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000764,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103429,0003-6870,2021,103429,94,Applied Ergonomics,Effects from loaded walking with polyurethane and styrene-butadiene rubber midsole military boots on kinematics and external forces: A statistical parametric mapping analysis,article,MARADESOUZAMUNIZ2021103429
"Work-related low back disorders are commonly associated with handling tasks. The objective of this study was to determine the combined influence of distance, pace, handled mass and height, on back loading and posture during free box transfer. Kinematics and kinetics of 17 handlers were recorded during a box transfer task between two pallets. Four-way repeated measures ANOVA were conducted on four lift-deposit height conditions (from lift and deposit of 0.16 or 1.16Â m), three distances between pallets (1.5, 1.0 and 0.5Â m), two handled masses (10 and 20Â kg) and two paces (free and faster). The interaction between distance and height on back loading and posture (PÂ <Â 0.001) showed that increasing distance to more than 1Â m is not recommended to avoid unnecessary cumulative loading. The shorter distance of 0.5Â m, which generally reduced the most spine loading, may increase it for transfers varying in height. The effect of pace to reduce spine cumulative loading and increase the peak asymmetric loading (PÂ <Â 0.05) was accentuated by mass, height and distance. The combined factors revealed the importance of tradeoff between peak, cumulative and asymmetric loading.","Manual material handling, Lifting, Musculoskeletal disorder, Back, Speed",Xavier Robert-Lachaine and Philippe Corbeil and Antoine Muller and Jasmin VallÃ©e-Marcotte and Hakim Mecheri and Denys Denis and AndrÃ© Plamondon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000247,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103377,0003-6870,2021,103377,93,Applied Ergonomics,"Combined influence of transfer distance, pace, handled mass and box height on spine loading and posture",article,ROBERTLACHAINE2021103377
"Insulin is a high-risk medicine that has been implicated in serious adverse events for hospital inpatients, including medication-error related deaths. Most insulin errors occur during administration, and â??wrong doseâ? is the most common type. A paper-based subcutaneous insulin chart (the â??NSICâ?) was developed for the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, using a range of human factors methods, with the aim of reducing the opportunity for errors. The present lab-based study empirically assessed whether the NSIC's human factors design translates into improved user-performance in the determination of insulin doses, compared with a pre-existing chart. Forty-one experienced nurses and 48 novice chart-users completed 60 experimental trials (30 per chart), in which they determined doses to administer to patients. Both groups determined insulin doses faster, and made fewer dose errors, when using the NSIC. These results support the utility of the usability heuristics employed in developing the chart.","Medication error, Patient safety, Human factors",Andrew Hill and Sophie J. Francis and Mark S.

"Taillight shape in a vehicle provides an essential lighting signal that enables the vehicle to be seen from the rear at night, thereby preventing rear-end crashes. This study aims to investigate the effects of taillight shape on vehicle conspicuity, and proposes ergonomic taillight shape solutions to vehicle designers and manufacturers. Two complementary experiments were conducted to examine three types of taillight shapes at three design levels. The first experiment was designed to investigate the detection speed of a driver and the fixation duration and fixation counts on leading vehicles with different taillight shapes, based on an eye-tracking methodology. The second experiment was designed to investigate the dynamic visual searching performance of a trailing driver for leading vehicles with different taillight shapes, based on a visual search task. The experimental results indicated that a long line-shaped taillight (striplight) was the optimal ergonomic solution for enhancing vehicle conspicuity. Vehicles with an enclosed contour-shaped taillight were more salient than those with an open contour-shaped taillight. Moreover, the experience and gender of the driver and the vehicleâ??observer distance were found to be closely related to vehicle conspicuity, and therefore, must be considered by vehicle designers when applying a specific taillight shape design. This study provides insights into the taillight shape design that not only aid vehicle designers or manufacturers in enhancing vehicle safety but also enable potential vehicle buyers to choose a safe lighting system.","Taillight, Shape, Conspicuity, Eye-tracking, Visual search",Shi-Jian Luo and Huan Lin and Yu-qi Hu,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000089,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103361,0003-6870,2021,103361,93,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of taillight shape on conspicuity of vehicles at night,article,LUO2021103361
"Stair design can influence the risk of stair falls. Stair nosings are intended to provide greater foot accommodation, although to date little is known about how the nosing shape can affect foot trajectory during stair ambulation. This study investigates the impact of different nosing shapes (round, square, tapered, and no nosing) on foot clearance and overhang measures during stair ascent and descent among healthy and post-stroke older adults. Slower cadence in ascent and descent, and greater foot overhang during descent highlighted the increased risk of stair falls for persons with chronic stroke. For both healthy and post-stroke participants, the tapered and round nosing shapes resulted in the largest horizontal foot clearance, and smallest foot overhang, respectively. However, given the greater step-to-step variability detected with round nosings, the tapered nosing presents as the safest choice among all evaluated designs. The results of this work can be used to inform architectural and accessible design standards for a safer built environment.","Fall prevention, Aging, Built environment",Sanaz Agha and Iris C.

"The accumulation of sweat and heat between the skin and the prosthesis is one of the common causes of discomfort experienced by post-mastectomy women who wore silicone-type external breast prostheses. This study aimed 1) to investigate the effect of a newly designed heat-reduction mastectomy bra on the thermal responses and thermal comfort performance; and 2) to propose an evaluation protocol for post-mastectomy products. The heat-reduction bra and the conventional bra were made of the same textile materials but the cup of the bra under discussion had a polyurethane cup with a perforated structure along the breast root/inframammary fold. The inframammary fold is often aggravated by heat, sweat, maceration, chafe, and lack of air circulation. Nine healthy male participants were recruited to participate in the study since the women who had undergone double-mastectomy were sensitive about their scars. An ingestible telemetric pill sensor was used to collect the data of core body temperature. Participants performed a 70-min five-phase exercise protocol wearing the heat-reduction bra and the conventional bra together with a silicone prosthesis with ventilation holes on the bottom. Physiological responses (i.e., core body temperature, skin temperature, temperature between bra and prosthesis, skin humidity and humidity between bra and prosthesis) and subjective sensation responses were measured. The results were statistically significant and the conventional mastectomy bra showed a higher core body temperature than that of the heat-reduction mastectomy bra (37.3Â Â±Â 0.3Â Â°C to 38.2Â Â±Â 0.5Â Â°C vs. 37.2Â Â±Â 0.3Â Â°C to 38.0Â Â±Â 0.3Â Â°C) starting from the middle of the sitting phase to the running phase and post-exercise resting (FÂ =Â 164.2, pÂ <Â 0.001). Both factors, the bra and the phase, have significant effects on the core body temperature (FÂ =Â 14.5, pÂ <Â 0.001).

"Consultations entail transitions in care between referrers and consultants, as patients visit different clinicians and care sites. This complex process has been consistently prone to communication breakdowns. Despite expectations and benefits of electronic health records (EHRs), incomplete, vague, or inappropriate referrals continue to hinder consultations; referrals can be sent to the wrong specialty service; and consultation findings frequently fail to reach referrers. Due to the inadequate support of interpersonal communication afforded by EHRs, these issues persist. Important aspects of ergonomics and human factors engineering frequently appear overlooked during the design and implementation of EHRs. Usability issues have contributed to delays in medical diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Some of these delays contribute to patient harms.

"Nurses in long-term care homes often crush pills into a fine powder using a manual pill crushing device. This study provides novel quantitative data on muscle loading experienced during pill crushing. The influence of surface height, number of pills and device orientation were studied in twelve muscles of the upper extremity. Variations in the work surface height and number of pills crushed resulted in static shoulder and forearm muscle activations that exceeded recommended static limits. In most cases, working at approximately a 50th percentile female's hip height (87Â cm) reduced the level of muscle activity, often to below the EMG-based exposure limit, compared to higher heights. A perpendicularly oriented device required substantially lower muscle activity in some shoulder muscles, with marginal differences occurring in muscles of the elbow and wrist. These data can inform practical design and work practice recommendations to reduce muscular activity while performing this important healthcare task.","Healthcare tasks, Pill crushing, Muscle exposure, Electromyography",Nicholas J. {La Delfa} and Archana Kunasegaram and Rachel Whittaker and Clark R.

"Introduction Work-related issues are already part of the theoretical framework and the historical rationale that underpin corporate sustainability. However, the relationship between work and sustainability is still little known in company practices. Based on the concepts of activity-centered ergonomics (ACE) and psychodynamics of work (PDW), this paper investigates the meaning of â??sustainable workâ? in Brazilian companies. Thus, two research questions guided this study: How the concept of â??sustainable workâ? can be defined in the perception of companies based on the perspective of ACE and PDW? How the concepts provided by these approaches can help companies in developing practices towards sustainable work? Method Case studies conducted in ten Brazilian companies engaged in corporate sustainability practices involving document analysis, interviews, and content analysis. Results Companies recognize the importance of human action in organizational processes, by considering people as the cornerstone for ensuring corporate sustainability, and seeking to build a work with meaning and significance. However, i) Improvement actions are usually mitigatory or compensatory, acting on the effects while the root causes remain untouched; ii) Sustainability initiatives focus on individual issues, in most cases on the leader (individual), narrowing its scope and neglecting broader, important topics such as work organization and work content; iii) Both work overload and work for sustainability agenda are usually disregarded; iv) A comprehensive view of health should not be limited to the workplace. Conclusions According to companies' perceptions, sustainable work includes but is not limited to integrating work to corporate sustainability guidelines, respecting labor laws and human rights, developing synergy between areas/departments towards sustainability, providing possibilities for constructing health in its multidimensionality with the worker as protagonist, and creating work that is meaningful, pleasurable and leads to happiness and recognition. ACE and PDW offer valuable concepts to support companies in bridging the gap between their corporate sustainability vision and practices, i.e., transforming guidelines into actions towards sustainable work. In this sense, sustainable work is believed to be that which improves the organization's performance and promotes professional development as well as workers' health broadly and positively (not limited to the absence of illness, but in the sense of building health) and well-being. Thus, it fosters respect for and the development of intelligence and creativity (as opposed to alienating work) by performing work that has meaning and significance, understanding the profound importance of physical, cognitive and organizational issues, and above all, the importance of work to the development of culture (Bolis et al., 2014).","Corporate sustainability, Work, Activity-centered ergonomics, Psychodynamic of work, Corporate social responsibility",Claudio M.

"We present a mesoergonomic approach to the early detection of neonatal sepsis, analyzing clinical data for 4999 patients from a neo-natal intensive care unit to predict positive culture results. The Apgar score at birth predicted positive results. For neonates with poor and intermediate Apgar scores, culture results for monitored infants were more likely to be positive than those for unmonitored infants. Thus, the medical staff tended to monitor infants who eventually had a greater chance for positive test results. A cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that for infants with high Apgar scores, the physician should decide whether to obtain a blood culture, based on the patient's characteristics. For infants with lower Apgar scores, it may be advisable to obtain a blood culture whenever one decides to monitor a neonate. The study demonstrates that staff decisions regarding a patient can serve as input for further clinical decision-making.","Clinical decision making, Late onset neonatal sepsis, Naturalistic decision making",Mila Orlovsky and Joachim Meyer and Alexis Mitelpunkt and Ahuva Weiss-Meilik,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301836,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103233,0003-6870,2021,103233,90,Applied Ergonomics,Patient monitoring as a predictor of blood culture results in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit,article,ORLOVSKY2021103233
"Automated decision aids can undoubtedly benefit system performance, but have the potential to provide incorrect advice, creating the possibility for automation disuse or misuse. This paper examined the extent to which increased automation transparency could improve the accuracy of automation use in a simulation of unmanned vehicle control. Participants were required to assign the best unmanned vehicle to complete missions. An automated recommender system provided advice but was not always reliable. Three levels of automation transparency were manipulated between-participants. Providing transparency regarding the reasoning underlying automated recommendations improved the accuracy of automation use, with no cost to decision time or subjective workload. Higher transparency in the form of projected decision outcome visualizations led to faster decisions, but less accurate automation use and an automation bias. Implications for the design of transparent interfaces to improve human-autonomy teaming outcomes in time-pressured environments are discussed.","Automation, Human-autonomy teaming, Unmanned vehicles",Adella Bhaskara and Lain Duong and James Brooks and Ryan Li and Ronan McInerney and Michael Skinner and Helen Pongracic and Shayne Loft,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301952,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103243,0003-6870,2021,103243,90,Applied Ergonomics,Effect of automation transparency in the management of multiple unmanned vehicles,article,BHASKARA2021103243
"In this paper, an adaptation of the system-theoretic process analysis (STPA) approach to a sociotechnical system of monitoring and tracking diabetes mellitus (DM) is proposed. Several human controllers such as the patient, physicians, other healthcare providers, and people in the social environment were considered in the hierarchical safety control structure. During the identification of the causal factors (causal scenarios) for the unsafe control actions of the human controllers, the three-phase approach proposed by France (2017) as well as the interaction problems between the subsystems in the hierarchical safety control structure were considered, and the implementation of the basic safety design procedure was included in the methodology for the improvement of system.

"The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of a newly developed steering unit with enhanced self-alignment and deadband on mental workload (MW) during heavy vehicle operation. Fourteen participants performed two tasks consisting of a lane keeping and a double lane shift with two tractors equipped with 1) a conventional and 2) an enhanced steering system. Physiological measurements, i.e., electromyography, electrodermal activity and heart rate were recorded during the tasks. Furthermore, performance measurements and subjective perception of MW were collected. Present study demonstrated that participants perceived the enhanced steering system requiring less mental demands to operate. Participants improved their performance during the lane keeping task and tended to improve in the double lane shift task with the enhanced system. Physiological measurements did not reveal differences between the steering systems. This study highlighted the dissociation of subjective indices of mental workload from physiological indices in driving of heavy vehicles.","Physiological indices, Heavy vehicles, Steering systems",Peter Dam and Malthe Bilgram and August Brandi and Mogens Frederiksen and Thomas H.

"Abstract Purpose This study investigates the effects of the usage of a novel camera system compared to a conventional lens system for manual precision tasks. Utilizing the novel camera system aims to improve neck posture, reduce neck muscle tension and thereby minimize the risk of neck pain. Methods Camera and lens systems were compared by assessing the craniovertebral angle (CVA), electromyographic activity of the M.trapezius and perceived exertion. 16 healthy participants (nÂ =Â 8 female, 24Â Â±Â 2 years; nÂ =Â 8 male, 30Â Â±Â 5 years) performed manual precision tasks in a cross-over design using both systems in sitting and standing positions. Results Analyses showed that using the camera system improved the CVA in sitting [28.4Â° (22.8Â°â??33.9Â°) to 42.5Â° (38.9Â°â??46.1Â°); pÂ <Â 0.01] and decreased the M.trapezius activity in standing [13.1% (7.7%â??18.6%) to 8.65% (5.49%â??11.81%)]. Additionally, overall and neck specific perceived exertion decreased when using the camera system in standing. Conclusions The camera system may prevent neck pain in workers performing manual precision tasks in sitting and standing postures.","Manual-repetitive work, Neck pain, Ergonomics",Julia GrÃ¤f and Klaus Mattes and Kerstin Luedtke and Bettina Wollesen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301046,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103147,0003-6870,2021,103147,90,Applied Ergonomics,Improved neck posture and reduced neck muscle activity when using a novel camera based workstation for manual precision inspection tasks,article,GRAF2021103147
"The objective of this study was to assess the impact of using alternative mast climbing work platform (MCWP) designs on trunk motion and postural stability with masonry workers while performing bricklaying and stepping down tasks using a conventional MCWP setting (i.e. with a step deck) as well as two types of production tables (straight- and L-shaped). The trunk angles and postural sway parameters of twenty-five masonry workers were recorded for the following tasks: (1) standing on a simulated MCWP and laying bricks on an adjacent wall, and (2) stepping down onto the step deck to get into position for doing the bricklaying task. Results indicated that the use of the L-shaped production table resulted in the lowest trunk ranges of motion and significantly reduced the workers' trunk angles in all three planes when compared to both the straight-shaped production table and the conventional approach of not using a production table. Data showed that both body sway velocity and area were significantly reduced when using either one of the production tables. The use of production tables significantly reduced impact sway forces when workers stepped from the main platform to the step deck. The use of production tables on MCWPs improved workersâ?? postures and overall stability, which could reduce the risk of injury.","Mast climbing work platform, Production table, Back injury, Postural stability",Christopher S.

"Digital human modeling software uses biomechanical models to compute workers' risk of injury during industrial work processes. In many cases, the biomechanics are calculated using quasistatic models, which neglect the body's dynamics and therefore might be erroneous. This study investigated the differential effect of using a dynamic vs. a quasistatic model on spinal loading during combined manual material handling tasks that are prevalent in industry. An experiment was conducted involving nine male and nine female participants performing a total of 3402 cycles of a box-conveying task (removing, carrying and depositing) for different box masses and shelf heights. Using motion capture data, the peak and cumulative moments acting on the L5/S1 joint were calculated using 3D dynamic and quasistatic models. This revealed that neglecting the dynamic movements (i.e., using a quasistatic model) results in an on average underestimation of 19.7% in the peak spinal moment and 3.6% in the cumulative moment that in some cases exceeds the maximal limit for the compression forces acting on the lower back.","Digital human modeling, L5/S1 moments, Biomechanical model, Ergonomics",Yaar Harari and Avital Bechar and Simone Asci and Raziel Riemer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302532,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103305,0003-6870,2021,103305,91,Applied Ergonomics,Investigation of 3D dynamic and quasistatic models for spinal moments during combined manual material handling tasks,article,HARARI2021103305
"This paper investigates whether spring-foam technology in an aircraft seat-pan can reduce weight and at the same time provide equal or better comfort. Firstly, through literature studies and using an iterative design process a prototype seat-pan was designed and developed using spring-foam technology. The (dis)comfort of this seat was compared with a standard aircraft seat-pan. Twenty two participants were asked to sit in each seat for 90Â min, completing a questionnaire every 15Â min. At the end of each seating session pressure map recordings were made of the seat-pans. The results showed that the prototype seat-pan has on average a significantly higher comfort for the first 30Â min and at a 60Â min recording than the standard seat-pan. The discomfort and long term comfort were not significantly influenced. The pressure distribution on the prototype seat-pan was significantly closer to an ideal pressure distribution than a conventional seat-pan. In addition, the prototype seat-pan had a significantly larger contact area and lower average pressure. The seat-cushion weighs 20% less than the conventional seat-cushion. The study indicates that a seat-pan design using spring-foam technology can be lighter and more comfortable than conventional foam cushion materials. It is recommended to optimize the prototype seat further and conduct long term (dis)comfort studies with a broader variation in subjectsâ?? age.","Pressure distribution, Comfort, Aircraft seat, Ideal seat contour",S.

"Training of surgeons is essential for safe and effective use of robotic surgery, yet current assessment tools for learning progression are limited. The objective of this study was to measure changes in traineesâ?? cognitive and behavioral states as they progressed in a robotic surgeon training curriculum at a medical institution. Seven surgical trainees in urology who had no formal robotic training experience participated in the simulation curriculum. They performed 12 robotic skills exercises with varying levels of difficulty repetitively in separate sessions. EEG (electroencephalogram) activity and eye movements were measured throughout to calculate three metrics: engagement index (indicator of task engagement), pupil diameter (indicator of mental workload) and gaze entropy (indicator of randomness in gaze pattern). Performance scores (completion of task goals) and mental workload ratings (NASA-Task Load Index) were collected after each exercise. Changes in performance scores between training sessions were calculated. Analysis of variance, repeated measures correlation, and machine learning classification were used to diagnose how cognitive and behavioral states associate with performance increases or decreases between sessions. The changes in performance were correlated with changes in engagement index (rrm=â??.25,p<.001) and gaze entropy (rrm=â??.37,p<.001). Changes in cognitive and behavioral states were able to predict training outcomes with 72.5% accuracy. Findings suggest that cognitive and behavioral metrics correlate with changes in performance between sessions. These measures can complement current feedback tools used by medical educators and learners for skills assessment in robotic surgery training.","Robotic surgery, Eye tracking, Electroencephalogram, Simulated training, Performance",Chuhao Wu and Jackie Cha and Jay Sulek and Chandru P.

"Nursing is often hazardous work. Promoting safety and care requires nurses to apply knowledge, skill and creativity in patient encounters. Nurses' risk exposures are well documented, with research on student nurses' safety more limited. We studied final-year nursing studentsâ?? risk perceptions using questionnaire-based vignettes involving four patient presentations on patient aggression, manipulating patient and resource risk factors. We found student nurses were most likely to ask for help and wait when managing high-risk patient aggression scenarios. Student nurses placed most importance on their own safety and patient condition in making decisions. Resource risk significantly interacted with gender, with male nurses more likely to seek help when risks were high. There is need to improve student nurse training on managing patient aggression by promoting creative approaches to problem solving and critical thinking using simulation techniques to enhance situation awareness and translate knowledge to practice.","Student nurses, Aggression, Risk perception, Creativity",Valerie O'Keeffe and Carolyn Boyd and Craig Phillips and Michelle Oppert,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018307555,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103248,0003-6870,2021,103248,90,Applied Ergonomics,Creating safety in care: Student nursesâ?? perspectives,article,OKEEFFE2021103248
"The purpose of this study was to identify challenges and action plans from 2.497 structured communication sessions between employee and supervisor and to gain insight into the processes of a quasi-experimental stepped wedge clustered intervention, which implemented workplace health literacy for reducing musculoskeletal pain among eldercare workers.

"This quasi-experimental study was conducted in a poultry processing industry with the aim of assessing the benefits of ergonomics educational training for novice and experienced workers in preventing work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Sociodemographic and occupational questionnaires were used to evaluate age, marital status, education, time in job, musculoskeletal complaints and pain intensity, perceived effort, biomechanical exposure, and perception of ease or difficulty in adoption of ergonomics educational training. Musculoskeletal complaints in the neck, back, and wrists were reduced with training, but pain intensity was reduced only in the wrist region. A reduction in the occupational biomechanical exposure from the baseline to immediately post-training and 2 months after training both for novice and experienced workers was also observed. The novice workers group differed from the experienced workers by presenting a higher reduction of biomechanical exposure in the cutting room. All workers in this study benefited from the ergonomics educational training in the short and medium term. However, the success of training was highly dependent on the content and approach of the training.","Human factors, Musculoskeletal disorders, Occupational health, Risk factors",Michelle Silveira Denadai and Sandra Regina Alouche and Daniela Pereira Valentim and Rosimeire Simprini Padula,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301848,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103234,0003-6870,2021,103234,90,Applied Ergonomics,An ergonomics educational training program to prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders to novice and experienced workers in the poultry processing industry: A quasi-experimental study,article,DENADAI2021103234
"Everyone can be susceptible to motion sickness (except those with complete loss of labyrinth function) and around one in three are known to be servery susceptible. Motion sickness can be experienced in many domains, including car travel, on a boat, using virtual reality headsets and simulator use amongst others. It is expected that due to potential designs and use cases, self-driving cars will increase motion sickness onset likelihood and severity for many car travellers. Besides medication, there are limited methods through which one can actively reduce their motion sickness susceptibility. This research develops a novel visuospatial training tool and explores the effect of visuospatial training on motion sickness. With a combined sample of 42 participants split between driving simulator trials (nÂ =Â 20), and on-road trials (nÂ =Â 22) baseline visuospatial skills and motion sickness were first measured. After a 14-day training period where participates completed 15-min of pen and paper tasks per day, it was found that visuospatial skills improved by 40%. This increase in visuospatial ability was shown to be directly responsible for a reduction in motion sickness by 51% in the simulator (with a 60% reduction in participant dropouts) and a 58% reduction in the on-road trial. This research has successfully identified a new method to reduce motion sickness susceptibility and the impact of these findings have wide reaching implications for motion sickness research, especially in the field of self-driving vehicles.","Human factors, Motion sickness, Driving simulator, Carsickness, Visuospatial, Mental rotation",Joseph Smyth and Paul Jennings and Peter Bennett and Stewart Birrell,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702030212X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103264,0003-6870,2021,103264,90,Applied Ergonomics,A novel method for reducing motion sickness susceptibility through training visuospatial ability â??

"Most usability assessments of medical devices describe the problems of individual devices in detail, but few account for the real context of use or provide designers with actionable guidelines for improvement. To fill this gap, this paper reports the results of a case study on the usability of operating room technologies and documents the creation of contextual design guidelines for operating room device design. We spent 64Â h in a gynecological operating unit conducting interviews with staff and observing device use during surgery. With qualitative analysis methods and based on existing usability principles, we created 21 design guidelines for the operating room context. The new guidelines highlight interactions between multiple devices, staff members, as well as other contextual factors. While the guidelines require further validation, they can potentially support the creation of more safe, ergonomic, and intuitive medical devices.","Usability, Operating room, Design guidelines",Antti Surma-aho and Katja HÃ¶lttÃ¤-Otto and Kaisa NelskylÃ¤ and Nina C.

"Touchscreen has gained increasing popularity. However, little is known about touchscreen use in vibration environments. This study aimed to examine the effects of control-to-display gain (GAIN) and operation precision requirement on touchscreen operations in varied vibration environments. Twenty participants attended an experiment where they were instructed to perform three types of basic touchscreen operation tasks in static, low vibration, and high vibration environments, respectively. Five GAINs (0.75, 1, 2, 3 and 4) and three operation precision requirements (90%, 95%, and 99%) were examined. The results indicated that vibration exerted adverse effects on task performance, and increased perceived workload, perceived task difficulty and discomfort. Task completion time showed a U-shaped curve as GAIN increased. Lowering operation precision requirement improved task performance and reduced perceived workload, especially in vibration environments and at larger GAINs. The findings provide practical implications on the design of usable touchscreen interfaces in vibration environments.","Touchscreen operations, Vibration environments, Control-to-display gain, Operation precision requirement",Da Tao and Jihong Zeng and Kaifeng Liu and Xingda Qu,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302416,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103293,0003-6870,2021,103293,91,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of control-to-display gain and operation precision requirement on touchscreen operations in vibration environments,article,TAO2021103293
"In this article, we compare and evaluate two methods of procedure design using an aircraft go-around (GA) as a test scenario. We contrast the manufacturer specified, crew-centric procedure with a redesigned process-centred perspective. We test the claim that the process-centred design can take into account situational factors more effectively and generate less workload. We report a heuristic assessment of the new procedure against design guidelines and an evaluation in a full-flight simulator at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) using qualified airline pilots to assess workload and performance. Both the manufacturer specified and new procedure were employed in three GA scenarios representative of increasing operational complexity. Results demonstrate an advantage for the new procedure design in the most complex scenario. The new, process-based procedure can reduce reported crew workload and improve response flexibility in more complex scenarios, improving rated performance. This study suggests that the process-based account in procedure design has advantages when compared to the flight crew-centric approach. These advantages include enhanced flexibility, robustness and improved crew performance during GA.","Standard operating procedures, Go-around, Procedure design, Workload",Tim AndrÃ© Schmidt and Houda Kerkoub Kourdali and Jim Nixon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301964,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103244,0003-6870,2021,103244,90,Applied Ergonomics,Evaluating process-based and crew- centred approaches to procedure design in aviation: workload and performance changes in go-around manoeuvres,article,SCHMIDT2021103244
"Traffic signs are an integral part of the traffic control plan and they provide road users with necessary information on the upcoming situation. This paper aims to examine the level of understanding of traffic sign imagery used in different countries and to track participants' eye movement when they encounter unfamiliar signs. Tobii eye tracking glasses were used to track gaze differences between familiar and unfamiliar traffic signs. Our findings show that sign characteristics (such as the amount of information on the sign) and the observer's knowledge of the sign meaning have a significant impact on eye behaviour. Signs containing more information (loaded with more content) and unfamiliar to the participant systematically produced the longest overall and average fixations and gazing duration. Given that longer gaze time for unfamiliar traffic signs presents a potential traffic hazard, we evaluated the need for standardization of traffic signs.","Cross-cultural, Eye tracking, Traffic safety, Traffic sign",Dario BabiÄ? and Helena DijaniÄ? and Lea Jakob and Darko BabiÄ? and Eduardo Garcia-Garzon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301447,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103191,0003-6870,2020,103191,89,Applied Ergonomics,Driver eye movements in relation to unfamiliar traffic signs: An eye tracking study,article,BABIC2020103191
"Workers who experienced prolonged sitting have higher risk of mortality from all causes compared to non-sedentary workers. However, work can also be a health enhancement opportunity and it also can be designed to improve health and well-being. This research presents a novel intervention designed to reduce sedentary behavior in the workplace. Seven teams of employees (NÂ =Â 30) conducted two meetings: one in a sitting position and one on a stationary bike. Repeated measures for heart rate, perceptions of stress, well-being, focus, attention and fatigue were collected before, during and after both meetings. Heart rate was significantly higher during active meeting. Results also indicated a significant effect of active meeting on stress. Well-being, focus and attention were similar during both meetings. Fatigue was perceived to be reduced in the hours following the active meeting. This suggests that active meetings can promote health without impairing performance which offers new perspectives for interventions.","Active meetings, Sedentary behavior, Physical activity",ValÃ©rie Hervieux and Angelo Tremblay and Caroline Biron,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302180,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103269,0003-6870,2021,103269,90,Applied Ergonomics,Active meetings on stationary bicycle: An intervention to promote health at work without impairing performance,article,HERVIEUX2021103269
"There is limited evidence on the efficacy of insole materials to reduce plantar pressure during regular walking and loaded walking. In-shoe plantar pressures and subjective footwear comfort were recorded in twenty healthy participants at a self-selected treadmill walking speed in six conditions: two commercial insoles or no insole, and with or without carrying a load in a backpack. A single-material insole, comprised of polyurethane, had reduced density and compressive stiffness compared to a dual-material insole with added viscoelastic material in rearfoot and forefoot regions. Load carriage increased peak pressure across the foot. Both insoles reduced plantar pressure in the rearfoot. Yet, the softer single-material insole also attenuated forefoot pressure and loaded walking did not appear to cause bottoming-out of the polyurethane. Plantar pressure changes did not affect perceived footwear comfort. The softer single-material insole was more effective in reducing plantar pressure, further research would confirm if this influences injury prevalence.","Plantar pressure, Density, Load-carriage",Georgia Melia and Petros Siegkas and Jodie Levick and Charlotte Apps,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302465,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103298,0003-6870,2021,103298,91,Applied Ergonomics,Insoles of uniform softer material reduced plantar pressure compared to dual-material insoles during regular and loaded gait,article,MELIA2021103298

The current study tested a large sample of anthropometric data for mismatch levels against national and international office furniture standards using dynamic seating as a framework with traditional and perching mismatch equations, applied to three recommended dynamic seating components. Dimensions present in the standards used did not match the majority of the sample. For sitting, seat width and depth individually presented the lowest levels of match, as well as under cumulative fit of all office furniture dimensions. However, these were alleviated when incorporating adjustability. Perching was shown to be generally impeded given commercially-available chair height options. Limitations in state-of-the-art perching equations are discussed, and two new models are proposed as design alternatives. Further research should focus on testing the criteria presented in this research through discomfort and objective measures.","Perching, Sitting, Posture, Comfort, Office",HÃ©ctor Ignacio Castellucci and Carlos Viviani and Pedro Arezes and Johan F.M.

"Design and development of contemporary military body armour has traditionally focused primarily on male soldiers. As the anthropometric body dimensions of male and female soldiers differ, we aimed to determine whether current body armour was meeting fit and functional requirements of female soldiers. One-hundred and forty-seven female Australian Defence Force soldiers completed a 59-item questionnaire regarding the fit and function of current body armour. Most (68%) participants reported wearing ill-fitting body armour, which was associated with increased total musculoskeletal pain and discomfort, as well as pain at the shoulders, abdomen, and hips. Body armour that was too large was more likely to interfere with task performance when it was integrated with a combat belt, as well as when female soldiers performed operationally representative tasks. Modifying body armour design and sizing to cater to the anthropometric dimensions of female soldiers is recommended.","Body armour, Female soldiers, Fit, Musculoskeletal pain and discomfort, Integration, Movement interference",Celeste E.

"Many sensor fusion algorithms for analyzing human motion information collected with inertial measurement units have been reported in the scientific literature. Selecting which algorithm to use can be a challenge for ergonomists that may be unfamiliar with the strengths and limitations of the various options. In this paper, we describe fundamental differences among several algorithms, including differences in sensor fusion approach (e.g., complementary filter vs. Kalman Filter) and gyroscope error modeling (i.e., inclusion or exclusion of gyroscope bias). We then compare different sensor fusion algorithms considering the fundamentals discussed using laboratory-based measurements of upper arm elevation collected under three motion speeds. Results indicate peak displacement errors of <4.5Â° with a computationally efficient, non-proprietary complementary filter that did not account for gyroscope bias during each of the one-minute trials. Controlling for gyroscope bias reduced peak displacement errors to <3.0Â°. The complementary filters were comparable (<1Â° peak displacement difference) to the more complex Kalman filters.","Inclinometer, Kalman filter, Complementary filter, Inertial measurement units, Inertial-based motion capture",Howard Chen and Mark C.

"Right-angle power-tools (RAPT) employed in automotive manufacturing promote greater productivity and quality fastenings, as well as, improve process efficiency. Due to RAPT technological advances automotive manufactures desire to understand their ergonomics consequences within a laboratory environment, however, laboratory-based representation must accurately represent the real world. A survey within automotive assembly plants was conducted to capture RAPT operation data. After examining 80 total RAPT operations, we logged the 3D locations of the fastener location (with respect to the operator), direction and the hand placement location used by operators. Four common locations with respect to the midpoint between the ankle (in cm; X = sagittal plane, Y = transverse plane, Z = coronal plane): 1) 2, 113, 62; 2) 42, 104, 45; 3) -26, 151, 36; 4) -37, 92, 52. These locations can be used to simulate RAPT operations within a laboratory. The survey provided insight into current workstation layout when operating RAPTs and, knowledge for laboratory-based RAPT examinations so that simulated tasks best represent their operation in automotive manufacturing.","Ergonomics, Power-tools, Workstation Design, Automotive Assembly",Jeffrey Lidstone and Gwen Malone and Ryan Porto and Allison Stephens and Marty Smets and Marc Banning and Joel Cort,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301253,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103171,0003-6870,2021,103171,90,Applied Ergonomics,A survey of right-angle power tool use in Canadian automotive assembly plants,article,LIDSTONE2021103171
"This study examined the characteristics of perceived discomfort and postural shifts at different magnitudes during a 4-h sitting period and the association between perceived discomfort and number of postural shifts. Forty healthy participants continuously typed a standardized text passage at a computer work station for 4Â h. Subjects rated perceived body discomfort using Borg's CR-10 scale in 10 body regions (i.e. neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist/hand, upper back, lower back, buttock, thigh, knee, and ankle/foot). A seat pressure mat device was used to gather seat pressure data during sitting. Postural shifts were determined by analysis of the dispersion index of both ischial tuberosities from seat pressure data. The threshold for a postural shift was set at Â±10% and Â±20%. Perceived discomfort in all body regions increased continuously during a 4-h sitting period. The body regions with the highest perceived discomfort were the low back, buttocks, upper back, thigh, and neck. The average (Â±SD) numbers of postural shifts during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th hour of sitting were 14.8Â Â±Â 9.5, 17.8Â Â±Â 9.4, 18.2Â Â±Â 11.1, and 18.1Â Â±Â 9.8 shifts per hour for the 10% threshold, and were 4.8Â Â±Â 4.4, 6.0Â Â±Â 5.6, 7.4Â Â±Â 6.7, and 7.7Â Â±Â 6.6 shifts per hour for the 20% threshold, respectively. Prolonged sitting led to an increase in perceived musculoskeletal discomfort over time. The number of postural shifts at both magnitudes increased in the first 2Â h of sitting and, in the second 2-h period of sitting, only the number of larger postural shifts (with 20% threshold) increased. The findings extend our understanding of sitting behaviors.","Musculoskeletal disorders, Low back pain, Computers, Office workers",Pooriput Waongenngarm and Allard J. {van der Beek} and Nipaporn Akkarakittichoke and Prawit Janwantanakul,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301770,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103225,0003-6870,2020,103225,89,Applied Ergonomics,Perceived musculoskeletal discomfort and its association with postural shifts during 4-h prolonged sitting in office workers,article,WAONGENNGARM2020103225
"The aim of this study is to investigate the usefulness of the anomaly detection method by one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) for the evaluation of mental workload (MWL) during automobile driving.

The N-back task had five difficulty levels from â??noneâ? to â??3-back.â? Eye and head movements were measured during the DS driving. Results showed that the standard deviation (SD) of the gaze angle, SD of eyeball rotation angle, share rate of head movement, and blink frequency had significant correlations with the task difficulty. The decision boundary of OCSVM could detect 95% of high MWL state (i.e., â??3-backâ? state).

"Manual material handling training (MMHT) is of questionable value according to five meta-analyses. However, little is known about why this is so. The aim of this study is to take a closer look at how MMHT are evaluated in order to identify what could explain judgement about their (lack of) effectiveness. Seventy-seven studies were included in a scoping review, and were analyzed using an inductive grid comprising numerous criteria. Workplace training programs, being the most frequent, were described in these papers in greater detail. Given the broad range of contexts it was found that MMHT differed greatly from one study to the other. All the while, contents presented through these programs were surprisingly uniform, with an emphasis on adopting the safe handling technique commonly known as â??straight back, bent kneesâ?, although such training approach principally focuses on the trainee's behaviours, while paying little (to no) attention to the work conditions that might condition correct behavioral display. Limitations of current MMHT are discussed and explanations are given in order to better explain why they are reported to be so ineffective.

"This study was designed to validate a short-duration sustained visual search task for the assessment of sustained attention in process control environments. The task consists of 10 short dynamic scenarios, which require participants (NÂ =Â 121) to monitor simulated operating power transmission interfaces, and identify system faults. A vigilance decrement was demonstrated throughout the sustained visual search task, as evident in increased response latencies and decreased accuracy over time. Further, changes in response latency throughout the sustained visual search task were positively associated with changes in response latency during a 30-min, low signal probability task, a 45-min low signal probability task, and a 45-min high signal probability task. The findings indicate that the sustained visual search task may be a valid alternative to a longer-duration process control task for experimental studies, and is likely to be of value for assessments of the capacity for sustained attention of operators in process control environments.","Vigilance, Process control, Power control, Rail control",Daniel Sturman and Mark W.

"Advancements in sensing and network technologies have increased the amount of data being collected to monitor the worker conditions. In this study, we consider the use of time series methods to forecast physical fatigue using subjective ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and gait data from wearable sensors captured during a simulated in-lab manual material handling task (Lab Study 1) and a fatiguing squatting with intermittent walking cycle (Lab Study 2). To determine whether time series models can accurately forecast individual response and for how many time periods ahead, five models were compared: naÃ¯ve method, autoregression (AR), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), vector autoregression (VAR), and the vector error correction model (VECM). For forecasts of three or more time periods ahead, the VECM model that incorporates historical RPE and wearable sensor data outperformed the other models with median mean absolute error (MAE) <1.24 and median MAE <1.22 across all participants for Lab Study 1 and Lab Study 2, respectively. These results suggest that wearable sensor data can support forecasting a workerâ??s condition and the forecasts obtained are as good as current state-of-the-art models using multiple sensors for current time prediction.","Fatigue forecast, Material Handling, Vector Error Correction Model, Wearable Sensors",Sahand Hajifar and Hongyue Sun and Fadel M.

"Modeling the shape of the scalp and face is essential for the design of protective helmets and other head-borne equipment. However, head anthropometry studies using optical scanning rarely capture scalp shape because of hair interference. Data on scalp shape is available from bald men, but female data are generally not available. To address this issue, scalp shape was digitized in an ethnically diverse sample of 100 adult women, age 18â??59, under a protocol that included whole head surface scanning and scalp measurement using a three-dimensional (3D) coordinate digitizer. A combined male and female sample was created by adding 3D surface scans of a similarly diverse sample of 80 bald men. A statistical head shape model was created by standardizing the head scan data. A total of 58 anatomical head landmarks and 12 head dimensions were obtained from each scan and processed along with the scans. A parametric model accounting for the variability of the head shape under the hair as a function of selected head dimensions was developed. The full-variable model has a mean shape error of 3.8Â mm; the 95th percentile error was 7.4Â mm, which were measured at the vertices. The model will be particularly useful for generating a series of representing a target population as well as for generating subject-specific head shapes along with predicted landmarks and dimensions.

"This research aimed to develop a comprehensive evaluation of the mobile user interface abilities of the elderly so that technology can be designed to meet individualized needs. A total of 135 older adults were evaluated with the developed system, the Elderly Mobile User Interface Ability Evaluation System (EMUIAES). The prediction of age and the use of technology on elderly mobile interface usage were investigated based on the findings of the evaluation. The relationship between performance on Fitts' task and elderly mobile user interface ability (EMUIA) was also examined. The findings showed a strong effect of age on the elderly's use of mobile user interfaces. Previous experience with personal and tablet computers also contributed to the use of mobile user interfaces. In addition, this research demonstrated the application of Fitts' law to describe the elderly mobile user interface behaviors, particularly for tasks involving fast tapping and pointing. The EMUIAES can provide future researchers and designers a comprehensive tool to describe the elderly's diverse behaviors and changes in their ability to use mobile interfaces.

"Thousands of people work in the precast/pre-stressed concrete industry every day. Due to the design of the precast/prestressed concrete product itself and the processes required for its production, employees are occasionally exposed to hazards. The industry recognizes this and devotes a significant amount of time and investment to mitigate these hazards and protect employees from harm. It is essential for employees to go through appropriate safety training before starting work in the plant. Practical safety training should be cost-effective, and performance guaranteed, and traditional training procedures include paper-based safety guidelines, lectures, videos, and on-site training. Virtual Reality (VR) provides an innovative approach for safety training as it could offer situational training with negligible risk and at a low cost. In this paper, a VR training module is developed to deliver safety training in a cost-effective yet repeatable manner, aiming to reduce common plant injuries. The module is developed using Unity3D and Visual Studio joint platforms and can be interfaced with using the Oculus Rift/Oculus S. The module addresses three major safety concerns in the plant: personal protective equipment (PPE), the tensioning of strand (the stressing process), and suspended loads. Efficacy and effectiveness analyses were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed VR module. The efficacy analysis was based on simulation sickness, user experience, and system usability. This analysis showed that the developed VR module is a user-friendly simulator with minimal simulation sickness. More than 50% of the participants reported no indications of simulation sickness. In addition, an effectiveness analysis was performed based upon a comparative study of this VR training method and the traditional video-based training method. This analysis indicated that VR training is more engaged and provides a better understanding of safety protocols and real-life experience of the precast/prestressed concrete plant.","Virtual reality, Safety training, Precast/pre-stressed concrete, Precast concrete, Efficacy analysis, Effectiveness analysis",Sayali Joshi and Michael Hamilton and Robert Warren and Danny Faucett and Wenmeng Tian and Yu Wang and Junfeng Ma,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302349,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103286,0003-6870,2021,103286,90,Applied Ergonomics,Implementing Virtual Reality technology for safety training in the precast/ prestressed concrete industry,article,JOSHI2021103286
"With advances in information technology, people spend more time on touchscreen-based virtual keyboards than physical keyboards. However, typing on touchscreens usually lacks informative tactile feedback and anchoring references to locate the right keys, and thus requires more visual attention. Most prior tactile keyboard research used single stimulus pattern, which was not enough to recognize different keys. The purpose of this study was to investigate the usability of multiple vibrotactile feedback patterns in an entire virtual QWERTY keyboard input. A set of highly discriminable vibration patterns was designed and associated with different regions of a virtual keyboard to help users to locate the right keys. However, the number of stimulus patterns might also affect the typing performance. A user study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the multiple vibrotactile feedback. The results showed that an appropriate number of stimulus patterns provided higher typing speed, higher typing efficiency, and lower error rate.","Virtual keyboard, Touchscreen, Usability, Multiple vibrotactile feedback, Discriminable vibration patterns",Chia-Hsuan Kung and Tzu-Chieh Hsieh and Shana Smith,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302192,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103270,0003-6870,2021,103270,90,Applied Ergonomics,Usability study of multiple vibrotactile feedback stimuli in an entire virtual keyboard input,article,KUNG2021103270
"This study investigated kinematic and perceptual differences between the sexes in a heavy lifting and pulling task. A 20Â kg box was lifted from floor to chest height, and a 70Â kg mannequin pulled across 20m. The effect of height, mass and average grip strength on kinematics and perceived workload was examined in 42 (19 females, 23 males) healthy individuals. A univariate linear regression analysis found females lifted with greater lumbar extension compared to males (pÂ <Â 0.001), and adopted more hip (pÂ =Â 0.006) and knee flexion (pÂ =Â 0.036) in the pulling task. Females reported a greater perceived workload in both tasks (pÂ <Â 0.001). After the multivariable analysis, only grip strength remained significant for perceived workload in the lift (pÂ =Â 0.04), and height for knee flexion in the pull (pÂ =Â 0.009). This highlights that height and strength are important factors driving kinematics and perceived workload.

"Research in aviation and driving has highlighted the importance of training as an effective approach to reduce the costs associated with the supervisory role of the human in automated systems. However, only a few studies have investigated the effect of training on highly automated driving. Moreover, available interactive trainings are mostly based on automated driving simulators and the application of immersive technology such as Virtual Reality (VR) as a low-cost training solution has not been widely adopted. In this study, we developed three types of familiarization tours (low-fidelity VR, high-fidelity VR, and video) to train first-time users of highly automated cars. Then, the effectiveness of these tours was investigated on automation trust and driving performance in several critical and non-critical transition tasks in four groups: control, video, low-fidelity VR, and high-fidelity VR. The results revealed the positive impact of the tours on trust and transition performance at the first time of measurement. Takeover quality only improved when practices were presented in high-fidelity VR. After three times of exposure to transition requests, trust and transition performance of all groups converged to those of the high-fidelity VR group, demonstrating that: a) experiencing takeover transition during the training may reduce costs associated with first critical takeover request in highly automated driving, b) the VR tour with high level of interaction fidelity was superior to other training methods, and c) untrained and less-trained drivers learned about automation after a few trials. Knowledge resulting from this research could help develop cost-effective solutions for automated driving training in dealerships and car rental centers.","Virtual reality (VR), Interaction fidelity, Training, Trust, Takeover, Highly automated driving",Mahdi Ebnali and Richard Lamb and Razieh Fathi and Kevin Hulme,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301782,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103226,0003-6870,2021,103226,90,Applied Ergonomics,Virtual reality tour for first-time users of highly automated cars: Comparing the effects of virtual environments with different levels of interaction fidelity,article,EBNALI2021103226
"Medication safety during care transitions is a significant challenge, especially for older adults prescribed multiple medications.

"Falls on icy surfaces are the leading cause of occupational injuries for workers exposed to outdoor winter conditions. Slip resistant footwear has been shown to reduce the risk of falls for indoor workers but until recently, there was no accepted standard for evaluating the slip resistance of winter footwear on icy surfaces. Our team recently developed a lab-based testing protocol for measuring footwear slip resistance. This protocol, called the Maximum Achievable Angle (MAA) test, measures the steepest ice-covered slope that participants can walk up and down without experiencing a slip in a simulated winter environment. This lab-based protocol has found there is wide variability in the performance of commercially available winter footwear. In particular, we have found that a new generation of footwear that incorporates composite materials in the outsole, performs much better than most other footwear. The objective of this project was to investigate whether the footwear that performed well in our lab-based testing would reduce the risk of slips and/or falls in real-world winter conditions. One hundred and ten home healthcare workers from SE Health were recruited for this study and were asked to report their exposure to icy surfaces along with the numbers of slips and numbers of falls they experienced each week using online surveys over eight weeks in the winter. Fifty participants (the intervention group) were provided winter footwear that were among the best performing in the MAA test. The remaining sixty participants (the control group) wore their own footwear for the duration of the study. A total of 563 slips and 36 falls were reported over the eight-week data collection period. The intervention group consistently reported fewer slips (127 vs 436) and fewer falls (6 vs 30) compared to the control group. We found the slip rate in the intervention group was between 68.0% and 68.7% lower than the control group. Similarly, the fall rate was between 78.5% and 81.5% lower in the intervention group compared to the control group. These findings demonstrate that footwear that performs well in the MAA test can reduce the risk of both slips and falls in real-world winter conditions.","Slip risk, Falls, Homecare, Slip resistance, Footwear, Winter",Z.

"Automated aids are engineered to support operatorsâ?? decision-making in complex and task-saturated environments, alerting them of system status and critical incidents. However, even the most advanced technologies are susceptible to failure. Monitoring imperfect automated systems poses unique challenges related to operator attention and workload. This study empirically examined the effect of unreliable automation on monitoring performance and responses to auditory stimuli in a multi-tasking environment. Participants completed an experimental trial consisting of four flight-related tasks while monitoring for automation failures at one of three levels of automation reliability. Participants in a high reliability condition responded more quickly and frequently to auditory messages. No performance differences were found in system monitoring performance between reliability conditions. These results are relevant to the design of automated system and delivery of automated alerts, and they have implications for operator attention allocation strategies in multi-tasking environments.","Human monitoring of automation, Auditory preemption, Automation reliability, Multi-tasking, Automation-induced complacency",James C.

Fifty-five undergraduate students completed an assessment of cue utilisation prior to completing the rail control task during periods of lower and higher task demands. Situational awareness was assessed using Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) queries. The results indicated that, while both cue utilisation and situational awareness were related to the detection of the implicit pattern of train movements, they contributed separately to performance on the simulated rail control task. The outcomes suggest that cue utilisation and situational awareness may be separate constructs, where cue utilisation constitutes a capacity variable that is associated with changes in response to task demand and situational awareness constitutes an outcome variable that emerges through task exposure.","Situational awareness, SAGAT, Cue utilisation, Learning, Rail control, Simulation",Anthony D.

"Vibrotactile feedback training may be one possible method for interventions that target at learning better work techniques and improving postures in manual handling. This study aimed to evaluate the short term effect of real-time vibrotactile feedback on postural exposure using a smart workwear system for work postures intervention in simulated industrial order picking. Fifteen workers at an industrial manufacturing plant performed order-picking tasks, in which the vibrotactile feedback was used for postural training at work. The system recorded the trunk and upper arm postures. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were conducted about the usersâ?? experience of the system. The results showed reduced time in trunk inclination â?¥20Â°, â?¥30Â° and â?¥45Â° and dominant upper arm elevation â?¥30Â° and â?¥45Â° when the workers received feedback, and for trunk inclination â?¥20Â°, â?¥30Â° and â?¥45Â° and dominant upper arm elevation â?¥30Â°, after feedback withdrawal. The workers perceived the system as useable, comfortable, and supportive for learning. The system has the potential of contributing to improved postures in order picking through an automated short-term training program.","Work technique training, The smart workwear consortium, Intervention",Carl Mikael Lind and Liyun Yang and Farhad Abtahi and Lars Hanson and Kaj Lindecrantz and Ke Lu and Mikael Forsman and JÃ¶rgen Eklund,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301423,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103188,0003-6870,2020,103188,89,Applied Ergonomics,Reducing postural load in order picking through a smart workwear system using real-time vibrotactile feedback,article,LIND2020103188
"The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders is very high amongmidwives resulting in sickness absenteeism, functional limitation and staff shortages. There are several contributory risk factors having impact on the development of MSDs. This study aimed to (1) explore midwives' experiences and views about work-related MSDs and contributing risk factors, and (2) analyse working postures for musculoskeletal injury risks. A mixed method approach was used with interviews/focus group (nÂ =Â 15/7) and observations (nÂ =Â 22) of specific tasks (during birth and after birth) using the posture analysis observational method (Rapid Entire Body Assessment, REBA). The participants were midwives who had an active role in the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Services (NHS). It was found that MSDs were often attributed to the physical (working in awkward positions), organisational (longer shift hours, fewer staff, increased work load), psychosocial (defensive practice, higher demand) challenges of midwifery. All postures had very high to medium REBA risk levels with action categories indicating that action or further assessment is definitely necessary to reduce MSDs. This research provides a holistic approach by analysing risk factors and interactions in the work context to inform the development of risk management strategies. Midwifery working conditions have a big impact on developing musculoskeletal symptoms. Management of such symptoms will improve staff wellbeing, mother and baby safety, individuals' life trajectories and staff shortages.","Musculoskeletal disorders, Pain, Midwives, Risk factors, Postural analysis",Kubra Okuyucu and Sue Hignett and Diane Gyi and Angie Doshani,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302118,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103263,0003-6870,2021,103263,90,Applied Ergonomics,Midwivesâ?? thoughts about musculoskeletal disorders with an evaluation of working tasks,article,OKUYUCU2021103263
"Deficits in the accommodative and/or vergence responses have been linked with inattentive behavioral symptoms. While using automated systems (e.g., self-driving cars, autopilot), operators (e.g., drivers, pilots, soldiers) visually monitor displays for critical changes, making deficits in the accommodative and/or vergence responses potentially hazardous for individuals remaining actively engaged in the task at hand. The purpose of this study was to determine if symptoms of accommodative-vergence deficits predict an individual's level of task engagement and cognitive fatigue while performing a flight simulation task with or without automation. Eighty-four participants performed a flight simulation task with or without automation. Prior to task completion, self-report accommodative-convergence deficit symptoms were assessed with the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS). Before and after the flight simulation task participants rated their task engagement and cognitive fatigue. Electroencephalographic activity (EEG) was recorded concurrently during task performance. Results showed that higher scores on the CISS were related to increased feelings of fatigue and decreased ratings of task engagement. The CISS was also positively related to parietal-occipital fast alpha power during the last 10Â min of the task for participants using automation, suggesting increased cortical idling. CISS scores did not predict performance. Results have implications for optimizing operator cognitive states over extended task performance.","Convergence, Accommodation, Task engagement, Cognitive fatigue, EEG, Automation",Kyle A.

"We present a novel view of transitions from the lens of patient ergonomics (the â??science of patient workâ?), which posits that patients and other non-professionals perform effortful work towards health-related goals. In patient work transitions, patients experience changes in, for example, health, task demands, work capacity, roles and responsibilities, knowledge and skills, routines, needs and technologies. Medication transitions are a particularly vulnerable type of patient work transitions.

"This research represents one of the first qualitative studies to investigate fatigue in the tunnelling sector of the construction industry. It explores the opinions of tunnellers and their managers about how fatigue influences or is influenced by tunnelling, and how this is managed. Fatigue and sleepiness were discussed in six focus groups with frontline workers (nÂ =Â 42) and 10 manager interviews. Fatigue was seen to be a problem, with all participants having experienced, or recognised in others, the feeling of sleepiness whilst at work. Fatigue and sleepiness are not commonly discussed between tunnelling workers and they do not feel comfortable reporting instances of fatigue. The research shows that workers in the tunnelling construction sector are exposed to a wide range of occupational factors that potentially increase their vulnerability to fatigue, including the physical environment, repetitive and monotonous tasks, variable shift patterns and manual work. Additionally, personal factors such as social and family demands, long commute times and living away from home, can increase the risk of fatigue. The construction industry in general has gone some way to address fatigue and there is opportunity to further improve fatigue management. However, a major shift is needed before workers will feel able to openly discuss fatigue with their employer.","Fatigue, Shift work, Construction industry, Safety, Sleep, Sleepiness",Sally Maynard and Wendy Jones and Ashleigh Filtness and Alistair Gibb and Roger Haslam,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301873,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103237,0003-6870,2021,103237,90,Applied Ergonomics,Going underground: Fatigue and sleepiness in tunnelling operations,article,MAYNARD2021103237
"Back-support exoskeletons (BSEs) are wearable systems designed to reduce physical demands on the back, but which could have undesired effects beyond this design intention. Participants (nÂ =Â 18) used two commercial BSEs to complete a brief (~15â??20Â s) simulated manual assembly task in varying conditions, with outcome measures that included: working posture, activity levels in â??secondaryâ? muscle groups (shoulders and thighs), perceived balance, discomfort, and usability. Using a BSE led to small and inconsistent changes in working postures (e.g., < ~14Â° change in lumbar flexion), muscular activity in the secondary muscle groups (<Â±2% of maximum voluntary isometric contractions), or perceived balance. Limitations in movement were reported for both BSEs, however, along with moderate levels of discomfort. Task-specific responses were evident for all outcome measures, though these depended on the specific BSE used and differed between genders in many cases.

"Curved displays are believed to create a feeling of immersiveness similar to virtual reality. However systematic studies are needed to demonstrate that this is, in fact, true and under what conditions. In an experimental study 24 participants compared five different displays (concave, convex, hemisphere, sphere and a flat display) in terms of their immersiveness and perceptibility, and they also rated their overall preferences. Both immersiveness and perceptibility affected overall preference ratings. Participants gave higher preference ratings to the convex and concave displays, which were rated high in immersiveness and perceptibility, but gave lower preference ratings to the hemisphere/spherical display which had high ratings on immersiveness but low ratings on perceptibility. The study results imply that curved displays do indeed create a feeling of immersiveness. Concave and convex displays were rated highly favorably and should receive more attention for applications where visual experience and a feeling of immersiveness is particularly important.","Curved displays, Immersiveness, Perceptibility, User preference",Jacqueline Urakami and Henrique Matulis and Shio Miyafuji and Zhengqing Li and Hideki Koike and Mark Chignell,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302209,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103271,0003-6870,2021,103271,90,Applied Ergonomics,Comparing immersiveness and perceptibility of spherical and curved displays,article,URAKAMI2021103271
"Darknet marketplaces have emerged as a facilitator of identity crime and trading. This study aimed to (1) understand the entities and control and feedback mechanisms that influence identity crime prevention and occurrence on the darknet in the Australian system and to (2) comprehensively identify the implications of control failures across all system levels. The Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) was used to develop an identity crime control structure in consultation with subject matter experts and then the Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) was applied. The STPA identified 310 risk states, resulting from control failures and which were associated with the range of agencies, organisations, and individuals present across system levels. As darknet marketplaces rapidly evolve, alignment between these entities is necessary to enable agile system responses.

"Although lots of assistive devices have been studied to fight against caregivers' work-related musculoskeletal disorders, stand-and-turn devices effects on biomechanical constraints are still unknown. The aim of this study is to provide and compare quantitative data on loads in the low back area resulting from the use of a motorless stand-and-turn device and from manual patient handling. Nine caregivers participated to motion capture and ground reaction forces measurement sessions of three cases of handling: manual handling with one caregiver, manual handling with two caregivers, motorless device assisted handling. Forces and torques at the L5/S1 joint were computed through Inverse Dynamics process. Motorless device assisted handling required the smallest loads whereas manual handling with one caregiver required the biggest loads, the latter being in some cases twice as big as the former.

"Employing a field-based monitoring paradigm, the current study examined day-to-day fluctuations in actigraphy-based sleep recordings, cognitive performance (10-min psychomotor vigilance test; PVT), and self-reported recovery status among 14 submariners throughout a 67-day military mission. Mission averages reflected suboptimal sleep that was of short overall duration (5:46Â Â±Â 1:29Â h per 24-h day) and relatively low efficiency (82.5Â Â±Â 9.9%); suboptimal levels of cognitive performance (PVT mRTÂ =Â 283Â Â±Â 35Â ms; PVT response errorsÂ =Â 5.3Â Â±Â 4.8); and moderate levels of self-reported recovery. Whilst self-reported recovery status remained stable across mission days, small but consistent day-to-day increases in sleep onset latency and PVT mRT accumulated to reflect meaningful deterioration in sleep and cognitive performance across the entire 67-day mission (i.e., 47% and 16% of the overall mission average, respectively).

"Objective Currently, low back disorder (LBD) research focuses primarily on mechanical variables to assess whether task demands exceed tissue capacity; however, it is important to assess how other nonmechanical variables affect tissue capacity in a time-dependent manner. The current investigation sought to explore physiological responses to an acute lifting task, as lifting has been implicated as a risk factor in the development of LBDs. Methods Twelve participants completed two sessions of 2Â h of repetitive symmetrical lifting from floor to knuckle height under two conditions, matched for total external work (Low Force High Repetition (LFHR) and High Force Low Repetition (HFLR)). Full-body kinematics and ground reaction forces were measured throughout. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8), markers of systemic inflammation, were assessed from blood sampling at Baseline, 0, 4 and 24Â h post-lifting on both days. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were also performed on participants to quantify body composition. Results Significant load (HFLR and LFHR) * time (Baseline, 0, 4, 24Â h) interaction effects were found for both IL-6 and IL-8, where the LFHR condition resulted in greater responses at 0 and 4Â h post-lifting. Conclusions This was the first study of its kind to concurrently measure peak and cumulative spinal moments and their relationship to systemic inflammation in both sexes, while strictly controlling for confounding variables (e.g. physical activity, caloric intake, body composition, etc.). Greater levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were seen in the LFHR condition, likely due to the greater cumulative spinal moments in this condition.","Spine, Lifting, Inflammation, Cumulative/Peak Spinal Moments, Cytokines",Tianna H.

"Objective Compare musculoskeletal discomfort, productivity, postural risks, and perceived fatigue for a sit-stand-walk intervention between two workstation configurations â?? one, individually customized for office workers according to ergonomic guidelines (Ergo-Fit); another, self-adjusted by office workers according to their preference (Self-Adjusted). Methods 36 participants performed a 60-min computer typing task in both configurations using a within-participants, counterbalanced design. Musculoskeletal discomfort and perceived fatigue were reported through surveys; productivity was operationalized by typing speed and typing error; postural risks were assessed by RULA for seated work, and REBA for standing work. Results Musculoskeletal discomfort and perceived fatigue did not vary significantly between configurations. Postural risks for seated and standing work were significantly lower for Ergo-Fit configuration; productivity was significantly higher for Self-Adjusted configuration.

"Since the inception of High Reliability Theory in 1981, researchers and practitioners have theorized about the questions, â??How do you know if you're an HRO, and how do you validate it?â? Evidence now exists that organizations seeking high reliability and resilience have moved away from the theoretical phase, and into the application phase where organizations adopt the HRO hallmarks plus culture as operational targets and create interventions to effect change. The evidence of high reliability operations in organizations is key for validating that HRO is implementable and is also beneficial. After collecting over 1400 artifacts, we found 34 scholarly efforts published which purposefully targeted implementation measures toward achieving an HRO state and measured the outcomes. From that evidence, we concluded that three specific interventions have been used which were useful and generalizable to guide practitioners in moving toward an HRO state: process redesign, training, and organization redesign. We suggest that this evidence may assert that organizations which are not functioning as an HRO can be redesigned to do so.","High reliability organization, Resilience, High reliability implementation",Jaime Cantu and Janice Tolk and Steve Fritts and Amin Gharehyakheh,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301915,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103241,0003-6870,2021,103241,90,Applied Ergonomics,Interventions and measurements of highly reliable/resilient organization implementations: A literature review,article,CANTU2021103241
"Characterization of Whole-Body Vibration (WBV) exposure is important for the development and evaluation of mitigation strategies for occupational WBV. However, barriers associated with cost and complexity limit widespread use of current gold-standard accelerometer (GSA) measurement systems. Small, simple, low cost Acceleration Measurement Unit (AMU) devices with built-in batteries and memory potentially allow for more efficient collection of WBV data, but the measurement accuracy of these devices need to be evaluated. Using known acceleration inputs generated by an accelerometer calibrator and field collected vibration profiles simulating real-world vibration exposures, the measurements of an AMU device and GSA system were compared. Analysis of accelerometer calibrator data showed no significant difference in weighted acceleration (Aw) measurements between the systems (mean difference â??0.001Â m/s2, pÂ =Â 0.95). In field collected vibration profile testing, differences in Aw measurements were small (0.06Â m/s2, 4.6%).

A non-metric Multidimensional Scaling suggested that evocativeness was higher for the emojis featuring a damaged building. Linear Mixed Models indicated that emojis with fabricated vs. natural structures were judged as more evocative, simpler, and more universal when characterized by danger from falling objects.

"For shoulder muscle prevention, we investigated individual shoulder muscle performance and fatigue patterns in various external conditions, including three different % maximum voluntary contractions, six shoulder angles and 60-s durations of exertion. The rating of perceived exertion was also measured for comparison. The upper trapezius (UT), middle deltoid (MD), pectoralis major (PM), latissimus dorsi (LD) and serratus anterior (SA) were selected for assessment. Normalized median power frequency electromyograms were calculated for quantitative fatigue evaluation in ten participants. UT muscle was severely fatigued by extreme flexion angle rather than weight. MD muscle was the most rapidly fatigued after 15Â s duration. SA muscle was more fatigued at 0Â° than 30Â° adduction. LD and PM muscle fatigue were mostly due to external workload.

"The aim of this research is to investigate whether visual feedback alone can affect a driver's trust in an autonomous vehicle, and in particular, what level of feedback (no feedback vs. moderate feedback vs. high feedback) will evoke the appropriate level of trust. Before conducting the experiment, the Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) were piloted with two sets of six participants (before and after iterations), to ensure the meaning of the displays can be understood by all. A static driving simulator experiment was conducted with a sample of 30 participants (between 18 and 55). Participants completed two pre-study questionnaires to evaluate previous driving experience, and attitude to trust in automation. During the study, participants completed a trust questionnaire after each simulated scenario to assess their trust level in the autonomous vehicle and HMI displays, and on intention to use and acceptance. The participants were shown 10 different driving scenarios that lasted approximately 2Â minutes each. Results indicated that the â??high visual feedbackâ?? group recorded the highest trust ratings, with this difference significantly higher than for the â??no visual feedbackâ?? group (UÂ =Â .000; p = <0.001Â <Â Î±) and the â??moderate visual feedbackâ?? group (UÂ =Â .000; p = <0.001Â <Â Î±).

"Aim The aim of this study was to assess the work-related physical demands of long-distance truck drivers employed by a large gas delivery company in Canada. Methods A total of 15 truck drivers participated in a data collection that included self-reporting assessments, field observations, and direct measurements to describe daily tasks organization, postural demands, physical workload, and force exertions. Results Truck drivers' work was characterized by long working days ranging from 9.9 to 15.1Â h (meanÂ =Â 11.4Â h), with half (49%) of the total working time spent behind the wheel. The overall workload as measured by relative cardiac strain (18.7% RHR) was found excessive for the long term given the shift duration. Peaks of heart rate in excess of 30 beats per minute above the daily average occurred mainly while operating valves and handling heavy hoses during gas deliveries. The task of delivering gas at a client's site required a moderate work rate on average (8.3 mlO2/kg/min) requiring 24.4% or maximum work capacity on average. Conclusion Based on multiple data sources, this study highlights the risks of over-exertion and of excessive physical fatigue in the truck driversâ?? work that are coherent with the high prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain in this group of workers.","Long-distance truck drivers, Industrial gas delivery, Over-exertion, Physical workload, MSD",Firdaous Sekkay and Daniel Imbeau and Philippe-Antoine DubÃ© and Yuvin Chinniah and Nathalie {de Marcellis-Warin} and Nancy Beauregard and Martin TrÃ©panier,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301769,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103224,0003-6870,2021,103224,90,Applied Ergonomics,Assessment of physical work demands of long-distance industrial gas delivery truck drivers,article,SEKKAY2021103224
"The aim of this study was to compare simulator sickness symptoms while participants wore either a virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) headset. A secondary aim involved comparing how physical motion affects symptoms. During a simulation, participants wore VR and AR headsets while standing on a motion platform and firing at hostile ships under three motion conditions: No Physical Motion; Synchronous Motion, in which the physical and displayed motion were coupled; and Asynchronous Motion, in which the physical motion did not match the display. Symptoms increased over time but were not different with respect to headset or motion. The VR condition had higher accuracy and faster response time to the commence fire instruction. Further research is necessary to determine if this holds under more extreme motion. The use of VR or AR headsets for training under gentle motion conditions is practicable and should be permissible under normal conditions during deployment.","Virtual environments, Motion sickness, Simulation and training, Attentional processes, Perceptual-motor performance",Kyle A.

"Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has brought a shift in the traditional role of the driver. This paper applies a user-centred design approach to designing a new AV interior to better support drivers. Three empirical studies were conducted, involving a total of 92 drivers (with 44 in Study 1, 12 in Study 2, and 36 in Study 3) to explore user needs and requirements in an AV. In Study 1, safety and comfort, together with a variety of non-driving activities, were identified as the principal concerns about future autonomous vehicles. Based on these findings, Study 2 proposes a new rotatable seating position for AVs, with an in-vehicle information display to facilitate users' activities and situational awareness while driving. Study 3 consists of a series of laboratory simulator evaluation studies, and this indicated that drivers in the proposed design condition had better situational awareness in an AV when dealing with take-over situations. Such findings suggest the possibility of applying rear-facing seats in autonomous vehicles to support in-vehicle non-driving activities. Some specific implications of designs to enhance a driver's situational awareness have also been suggested.","Driver-vehicle interaction, Autonomous vehicles, In-vehicle system, Human needs",Xu Sun and Shi Cao and Pinyan Tang,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301885,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103238,0003-6870,2021,103238,90,Applied Ergonomics,Shaping driver-vehicle interaction in autonomous vehicles: How the new in-vehicle systems match the human needs,article,SUN2021103238
"Municipal waste collectors must avoid bag-body contact, requiring waste bags to be held further from the body. Donning sharps-proof clothing would permit bag-body contact, allowing the bag to be closer to the body, reducing biomechanical exposures. To test this hypothesis, 25 participants loaded waste bags into a simulated garbage truck hopper under two lifting (contact allowed, no contact) and bag mass (7Â kg and 20Â kg) conditions. Bottom-up rigid-link biomechanical modelling results including peak low back compression force, antero-posterior shear force and peak low back flexion angle were not different between the lifting conditions, but cumulative compression was decreased with bag-body contact, although only at the 20Â kg mass. Bag mass had significant effects on outcome measures, causing compression to increase to 4663 (Â±697) N, exceeding recommended thresholds. Sharps-proof clothing and municipally mandated 23Â kg maximum allowable bag mass restrictions may not sufficiently reduce biomechanical exposures to prevent MSD.","Occupational lifting, Ergonomics, Sharps-proof clothing",Christopher A.B.

"Building, bridge or wind turbine maintenance requires manual dexterity tasks by a specialist rope-access trained workforce via two principal means: harness suspension of individual workers from above, or deployment of a suspended platform or cradle from which workers access the structure to be maintained. Currently no published research compares accuracy and efficiency of simulated maintenance tasks between these modalities. This study investigated manual dexterity task performance of peg placement and shape delineation in seated, standing and suspended environments in 16 healthy controls and 26 professional rope-access trained individuals. Both seated and standing assessments were superior to those suspended, and height of suspension, total mass and years of experience had no influence on the task outcome. These findings suggest that, where feasible, cradle suspension mechanisms which permit standing maintenance are favourable in terms of task efficacy and where feasible, should be considered for deployment in wind energy and other engineering applications.","Rope-access, Harness suspension, Task performance, Pegboard, Shape delineation",Arthur D.

"Background Despite the breadth and diversity of research and policies on care transitions, research studies often report similar components that affect the quality and safety of care, including communication across professional groups and care settings, transfer of information, coordination of resources or training of healthcare personnel. In this article, we aim to deepen our understanding of care transitions by proposing a heuristic research framework that takes into account the components and factors influencing the quality and safety of care transitions in diverse settings. Methodology Using a pragmatic qualitative narrative meta-synthesis of empirically grounded research studies (NÂ =Â 13) involving 31 researchers from seven countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK), we conducted a thematic analysis to identify the components analysed in the included studies. We then used these components to create a framework for researching care transitions. Results Our narrative synthesis found that the quality and safety of care transitions are influenced by a range of patient-centred, communicative, collaborative, cultural, competency-based, accountability-based and spatial components. These components are encompassed within a broader set of dimensions that require careful consideration: (1) the conceptualising of the care transition notion, (2) the methodology for researching care transitions, (3) the role of patients and carers in care transitions, (4) the complexity surrounding care transitions, (5) the boundaries intertwined in care transitions and (6) care transition improvement interventions. These six dimensions constitute an analytical framework for planning and conducting research on care transitions in diverse settings. Conclusion The proposed six-dimensional framework for researching quality and safety in care transitions offers a roadmap for future practice and policy interventions and provides a starting point for planning and designing future research.","Healthcare, Care transitions, Quality and safety",Karina Aase and Justin Waring,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301800,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103228,0003-6870,2020,103228,89,Applied Ergonomics,Crossing boundaries: Establishing a framework for researching quality and safety in care transitions,article,AASE2020103228
"Antibiotic-resistant infections cause over 20 thousand deaths and $20 billion annually in the United States. Antibiotic prescribing decision making can be described as a â??tragedy of the commonsâ? behavioral economics problem, for which individual best interests affecting human decision-making lead to suboptimal societal antibiotic overuse. In 2015, the U.S. federal government announced a $1.2 billion National Action Plan to combat resistance and reduce antibiotic use by 20% in inpatient settings and 50% in outpatient settings by 2020. We develop and apply a behavioral economics model based on game theory and â??tragedy of the commonsâ? concepts to help illustrate why rational individuals may not practice ideal stewardship and how to potentially structure three specific alternate approaches to accomplish these objectives (collective cooperative management, usage taxes, resistance penalties), based on Ostrom's economic governance principles. Importantly, while each approach can effectively incentivize ideal stewardship, the latter two do so with 10â??30% lower utility to all providers. Encouraging local or state-level self-managed cooperative stewardship programs thus is preferred to national taxes and penalties, in contrast with current trends and with similar implications in other countries.","Tragedy of the commons, Antibiotic stewardship, Overuse, Incentive design",Brendan Bettinger and James C.

"Users frequently commit typing errors due to input language mode confusion (ILMC) when switching between multiple languages. This study evaluated two mode display cursors (MDCs) as a potential solution to ILMC: the monochrome and color-changing MDCs. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the two MDCs in different dimensions of usability. Experiment 1 evaluated the effects of MDCs on ILMC and related typing errors and Experiment 2, on self-reported preference, acceptance and annoyance. In Experiment 1, 45 participants were divided into three groups, that each performed multi-language typing using an ordinary mouse cursor and the two MDCs. The color-changing MDC was found to significantly reduce ILMC and related typing errors compared to the ordinary mouse cursor (pÂ <Â .001). In Experiment 2, 30 participants performed three typical computer tasks using both MDCs. The mean annoyance rating was significantly larger for the color-changing MDC than for the monochrome MDC (pÂ =Â .037).","Input language mode confusion, Multi-language typing, Mode displaying mouse cursor",Taekbeom Yoo and Haehyun Lee and Soomin Hyun and Woojin Park,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018307245,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103170,0003-6870,2021,103170,90,Applied Ergonomics,Mode displaying mouse cursors for reducing input language mode confusion: Utility and user attitude evaluation,article,YOO2021103170
"It is clear that the cognitive resources invested in standing are greater than in sitting, but six of eight previous studies suggested that there is no difference in cognitive performance. This study investigated the effects of sitting and standing workstations on the physical workload and cognitive performance under variable cognitive demand conditions. Fifteen participants visited two times for testing sitting and standing workstations, and were asked to play two difficulty levels of Tetris game for 40Â min while kinematic variables, CoP regularity, CoP SD, and cognitive performances were captured every 5Â min. Results revealed a more neural posture in standing than in sitting, but using the standing workstation degraded attention and executive function. The CoP SD was 7 times greater in standing, but the CoP regularity was 1/4 in sitting, denoting greater attentional investment while engaged at the standing workstation.","Standing workstation, Cognitive performance, CoP regularity",Sang Hyeon Kang and Juhyeong Lee and Sangeun Jin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302544,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103306,0003-6870,2021,103306,92,Applied Ergonomics,Effect of standing desk use on cognitive performance and physical workload while engaged with high cognitive demand tasks,article,KANG2021103306
"The risk of motion sickness is considerably higher in autonomous vehicles than it is in human-operated vehicles. Their introduction will therefore require systems that mitigate motion sickness. We investigated whether this can be achieved by augmenting the vehicle interior with additional visualizations. Participants were immersed in motion simulations on a moving-base driving simulator, where they were backward-facing passengers of an autonomous vehicle. Using a Head-Mounted Display, they were presented either with a regular view from inside the vehicle, or with augmented views that offered additional cues on the vehicleâ??s present motion or motion 500ms into the future, displayed on the vehicleâ??s interior panels. In contrast to the hypotheses and other recent studies, no difference was found between conditions. The absence of differences between conditions suggests a ceiling effect: providing a regular view may limit motion sickness, but presentation of additional visual information beyond this does not further reduce sickness.","Motion, Sickness, Anticipatory, Predictive, Visual, Autonomous, Vehicles",Ksander N. {de Winkel} and Paolo Pretto and Suzanne A.E.

"Repositioning patients in bed is the most common patient handling activity and is associated with musculoskeletal disorders in caregivers. Hospital bed features may mitigate the risk of injury. The current study investigated the effect of bed features on the physical stress on caregivers. Ten nurses were recruited to perform three repositioning activities. Hand forces were recorded, and spine loading was estimated using a dynamic biomechanical model. Results demonstrated that except for the peak L5/S1 compressive load in the turning task, the use of assistive features significantly reduced the physical stresses for all repositioning activities. However, recommended thresholds for injury were still exceeded in many conditions. Compared with spinal load, hand force was much higher relative to the injury thresholds, suggesting a greater risk of shoulder and upper extremity injuries than low back injury. Mechanical lift equipment remains the safest and most robust way to reposition a patient.","Patient handling, Patient repositioning, Musculoskeletal disorders, Physical stress, Hospital bed features",Jie Zhou and Neal Wiggermann,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702030209X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103259,0003-6870,2021,103259,90,Applied Ergonomics,The effects of hospital bed features on physical stresses on caregivers when repositioning patients in bed,article,ZHOU2021103259
"Environmental and logistical difficulties associated with obtaining whole-body vibration measurements from mobile equipment during operation in underground coal mines have hampered attempts to assess the potential vibration exposures associated with the use of such equipment. An alternative measurement technique was used to gather data from mobile equipment during normal operation at three low-methane coal mines and to estimate the possible magnitude of benefit of three control measures. 188 long duration measurements were obtained from shuttle cars (NÂ =Â 142, median measurement durationÂ =Â 3.2Â h); personnel transport (NÂ =Â 24, median measurement durationÂ =Â 2.4Â h); and materials transport vehicles (NÂ =Â 22, median measurement durationÂ =Â 1.8Â h). Whole-body vibration amplitudes either within or exceeding the ISO health guidance caution zone were consistently measured. In particular, shuttle cars demonstrated whole-body vibration amplitudes which frequently exceeded the health guidance caution zone. The potential effects of roadway maintenance, decreased vehicle speed, and shuttle car seat replacement were found to be practically meaningful.","Whole-body vibration, Underground coal mine, Shuttle car",Danellie Lynas and Robin Burgess-Limerick,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301174,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103162,0003-6870,2020,103162,89,Applied Ergonomics,Whole-body vibration associated with underground coal mining equipment in Australia,article,LYNAS2020103162
"While there is wide evidence that the occupational use of hand tools increases the risk of musculoskeletal disorder, evidence is limited regarding manual scissors, commonly used by custom tailors for bespoke garment production. We assessed whether scissor design impacts physical demands (muscle activity, perceived discomfort, and wrist posture) and task performance (quality and perceived efficiency). Twenty-four novice volunteers each completed simulated cutting tasks in 24 conditions involving the factorial combinations of four scissor designs (SD), three workstation heights, and two fabric types. SD significantly affected all outcome measures, and differences between SDs were consistent across workstation heights and fabric types. Two wide-handles scissors appeared superior overall, which may be related to the distinct grip type employed with this type of design. These results suggest that careful scissor selection has the potential to both reduce injury risk and enhance performance during fabric cutting tasks, though future testing is needed under more realistic conditions.","Scissor design, Hand injury, Physical demands, Custom tailors, Muscle activity, Task performance",Adedoyin A.

"Superimposing virtual visual information within the real world is referred to as augmented reality (AR). This technique becomes increasingly popular and due to technical advances can be applied to various purposes ranging from consumer entertainment to industrial use cases. Workplaces equipped with AR assistance-systems promise fast and accurate performance. Within the field of intralogistics, palletization constitutes a field of application which may benefit from guidance by AR. In the present investigation, participants performed a palletization task while they received instructions via three different devices (paper list, tablet, AR glasses). Performance data and subjective ratings were obtained. Participants subjectively preferred to work with the AR device. Number of errors was reduced while at the same time handling times were prolonged when the AR device was used. In all experimental conditions, performance improved in the course of the experiment. Least improvement was observed in the AR condition, which emphasizes that such applications allow decent performance without prior experience. Overall, the present results indicate that the utility of AR applications is limited when task demands are low. Such applications might be more useful in unclear and complex situations.

"A portable headset has been developed to analyze breathing gases and establish the energetic workload of physically active workers. This proof-of-concept study aimed to investigate the following: (1) the validity of the headset compared to indirect calorimetry using a mouth mask; (2) the validity of the headset compared to the validity of oxygen consumption (VÌ?O2) estimated on the basis of heart rate; (3) the influence of wind on validity; and (4) user experiences of the headset. Fifteen subjects performed a submaximal cycling test twice, once with the headset, and once with a mouth mask and heartrate monitor. Concurrent validity of the headset was analyzed using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Across all phases, a good correlation between the headset and mouth mask was observed for VÌ?O2, carbon dioxide production (VÌ?CO2) and exhaled volume (VÌ?E) (ICCâ?¥0.72). The headset tended to underestimate VÌ?O2, VÌ?CO2 and VÌ?E at low intensities and to overestimate it at higher intensities. The headset was more valid for estimating VÌ?O2 (ICCÂ =Â 0.39) than estimates based on heart rate (ICCÂ =Â 0.11) (nÂ =Â 7). Wind flow caused an overestimation (mdÂ â?¥Â 18.4Â Â±Â 16.9%) and lowered the correlation of VÌ?O2 between the headset and the mouth mask to a moderate level (ICCÂ =Â 0.48). The subjects preferred the headset over the mouth mask because it was more comfortable, did not hinder communication and had lower breathing resistance. The headset appears to be useable for monitoring development of the energetic workloads of physically active workers, being more valid than heart rate monitoring and more practical than indirect calorimetry with a mouth mask. Proof-of-concept was confirmed. Another design step and further validation studies are needed before implementation in the workplace.","Energy expenditure, Energetic workload, Physically demanding jobs, Blue-collar worker, Indirect calorimetry, Cardiopulmonary exercise testing",C.C.

"The effect of the load's center of gravity (CoG) on manual materials handling tasks received little attention in literature. The motivation of this study was to examine the effects of handle height, load's CoG height and load on lifting tasks. Eighteen participants performed 27 lifting tasks, including 3 handle heights (10, 30, 50Â cm) by 3 load's CoG heights (10, 30, 50Â cm) by 3 loads (7, 14, 21Â kg). The lifting time, maximum box tilt angle, muscular activity (brachioradialis, biceps brachii, deltoid, and erector spinae), maximum CoP velocity, and lifting difficulty were measured. The results showed that lifting time and maximum box tilt angle decreased with increasing handle height. Middle handle height (30Â cm) resulted in the lowest muscular activity, maximum CoP velocity, and lifting difficulty. Low load's CoG height decreased lifting time, maximum box tilt angle, muscular activity, and lifting difficulty, however, it also increased maximum CoP velocity. In addition, high load increased lifting time, maximum box tilt angle, muscular activity, maximum CoP velocity, and lifting difficulty.","Manual materials handling, Capacity, Work design",Tzu-Hsien Lee,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302428,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103294,0003-6870,2021,103294,91,Applied Ergonomics,"The effects of handle height, load's CoG height and load on lifting tasks",article,LEE2021103294
"Powered two-wheelers are a common means of transport all over the world. In several countries, primary motorcycles with high displacement involve another purpose, namely motorcycling is a leisure activity. Motorcycles are used as tools of transport pleasure as opposed to being purely used for individual commuting purposes. The aim of the current study involves investigating the relation between experienced riding pleasure and riding behavior in a field test. Specifically, NÂ =Â 12 motorcyclists between 21 and 66 years of age were observed while riding for approximately 8Â h on public roads. The measurement setup included a logger for vehicle dynamics and vehicle handling data, GNSS data, video data, and subjective measures recorded as audio comments at predefined points of interest along the round course. A comprehensive dataset with more than 6000Â km of motorcycling was gathered. The results indicate that parameters of lateral vehicle behavior, such as the maximum lean angle, reflected riding pleasure. Interestingly, this is applicable for curvy sections as well as straight roads. High ratings of riding pleasure correlated with riding in snaky lines as a type of self-stimulation on straight sections. Longitudinal vehicle dynamics, such as the range of accelerations, tend to increase with the riding pleasure in curves. Hence, the effects are smaller than those for lateral vehicle behavior and not visible on straight sections. Generally, curvy sections on rural roads produce higher pleasure than straight roads. On a global level, riding pleasure increases during the first few hours of riding and subsequently decreases with respect to the time on task. The results are discussed in the context of studies on driving pleasure from the automotive sector and more fundamental psychological theories that explain pleasure as a physiological stimulation or flow. Several individuals ride motorcycles to experience pleasure. A better understanding of rider behavior in these situations can aid in deriving proper assistance and to provide individual support to a rider, thereby increasing riding pleasure as well as safety.","Motorcycle, Powered two-wheeler, Rider profile, Human factors, Rider behavior, Vehicle dynamics",Sebastian Will and Barbara Metz and Thomas Hammer and Raphael PleÃ? and Matthias MÃ¶rbe and Markus Henzler and Frederik Harnischmacher,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018306392,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103231,0003-6870,2021,103231,90,Applied Ergonomics,Relation between riding pleasure and vehicle dynamics - Results from a motorcycle field test,article,WILL2021103231
"Operating a small carry-on unmanned aerial system (UAS) alone is challenging. Research on facilitating single-operator work has focused mainly on payload operation and health monitoring. Little focus has been given to mission-related aspects and how the command and control (C2) map display contributes to mission accomplishment. This study uses cognitive work analysis (CWA) to describe the operational work of the mission operator of a Skylark miniature UAS system. Three CWA phases were conducted â?? work domain analysis, control task analysis and strategy analysis â?? providing a rich framework of operational mission phases, task components, processes and the physical interface-objects in use. These representations highlight the operators' extensive use of the C2 map during all mission phases, for all object-related processes. To further enhance the outcomes of the CWA, and prior to outlining specific design requirements, an empirical investigation was conducted in which the eye movements of five experienced operators were obtained during a simulated mission. The empirical results confirm and further specify the work patterns that operators adopt. Quantitative analysis shows operatorsâ?? extensive focus on the map, especially during mission-critical phases. These analyses led to the conclusion that a significant change in the way operators interact with the C2 map, or alternative designs to enhance map-based information utilization, should be applied. Insights drawn from this analysis can be applied to other aerial surveillance work domains, and adding empirical evaluations is helpful to further refine and reinforce the CWA outcomes.","Cognitive work analysis, Single operator, Unmanned system, Map display, Command and control",Yonatan Back and Yuval Zak and Yisrael Parmet and Tal Oron-Gilad,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702030168X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103218,0003-6870,2021,103218,90,Applied Ergonomics,Combining cognitive work analysis and empirical evaluations to understand map use by operators of small carry-on unmanned aerial systems,article,BACK2021103218
"The aim of this study was to examine the relationship among attention span, instrument reading, and eye movement mode. Sixteen pilots participated in procedural tests for attention span and instrument reading ability while completing simulated flight take-offs. Different instrument types corresponded to different reaction times â?? as response time increased, presentation time decreased. It can also be seen from the attention distribution of the instrument area in take-off that different instruments receive different attention resources. Breadth and attention span not only have a direct impact on the ability to read the table but also have a mediating effect on eye movement pattern during flight. The study found a direct relationship between attention span and instrument reading and also verified the impact of the two on attention allocation during take-off. The results suggest that integration training for attention ability with instrument reading may enable more efficient pilot performance.","Attention span, Pilots, Instrument reading, Eye movement",Feng Shao and Tianjiao Lu and Xiuchao Wang and Zhenfu Liu and Yuting Zhang and Xufeng Liu and Shengjun Wu,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301976,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103245,0003-6870,2021,103245,90,Applied Ergonomics,The influence of pilot's attention allocation on instrument reading during take-off: The mediating effect of attention span,article,SHAO2021103245
"Farmworkers are exposed to physical risk factors including repetitive motions. Existing ergonomic assessment methods are primarily laboratory-based and, thus, inappropriate for use in the field. This study presents an approach to characterize the repetitive motions of the upper arms based on direct measurement using accelerometers. Repetition rates were derived from upper arm inclination data and with video recordings in the field. This method was used to investigate whether harvesting with mobile platforms (teams harvesting apples from the platform and the ground) increased the farmworkersâ?? exposure to upper arm repetitive motions compared to traditional harvesting using ladders. The ladder workers had higher repetitive motions (13.7 cycles per minute) compared to the platform and ground workers (11.7 and 12.2 cycles per minutes). The higher repetitions in the ladder workers were likely due to their ability to work independently and the additional arm movements associated with ladder climbing and walking.","Accelerometer, Agriculture, Productivity, Repetition",Ornwipa Thamsuwan and Kit Galvin and Maria Tchong-French and Lovenoor Aulck and Linda Ng Boyle and Randal P.

"Aim This study assessed the work-related physical demands of short-distance truck drivers employed by a large gas delivery company in Canada. Methods A total of 19 truck drivers participated in the data collection, which included a combination of self-reports, field observations and direct measurements to report on the work shift task composition, postures, physical workload, and force exertions. Results Driving (mean of 43% of daily work shift) and delivering gas cylinders to customers (28%) were the main tasks of the truck drivers. Delivering gas cylinders measured as moderate level work and daily work duration was not excessive with respect to mean cardiac strain for most drivers. However, manual handling and force exertion activities were frequent and deemed unsafe most of the time with respect to existing guidelines on manual materials handling. Conclusion This study documents physical risk factors that are consistent with musculoskeletal pain prevalence reported for short-distance truck drivers.","Short-distance truck drivers, Industrial gas cylinders, Manual materials handling, Physical workload, MSD",Firdaous Sekkay and Daniel Imbeau and Philippe-Antoine DubÃ© and Yuvin Chinniah and Nathalie {de Marcellis-Warin} and Nancy Beauregard and Martin TrÃ©panier,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301733,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103222,0003-6870,2020,103222,89,Applied Ergonomics,Assessment of physical work demand of short distance industrial gas delivery truck drivers,article,SEKKAY2020103222
"Countdown timers (CDTs) for pedestrians and cars have been shown to produce various effects, including improved efficiency and decreased safety. This study aimed to explore adaptive behaviours of cyclists towards a CDT to green traffic light, conducted as a before-after study in real traffic. Cyclists adapted to the CDT by searching for and using the information that it provided, mainly in terms of speed adaptation and glance behaviour. Start-up delays were reduced but there is a concern that red light violations could increase. There might be undesirable effects on crucial information intake in cases where the CDT was used not as a complement but as a substitute for the traffic light. The results essentially indicate that cyclists use the information provided by the CDT for their own efficiency, rather than for rule-based safety.","Countdown timer, Bicyclist behaviour, Adaptation",Sara NygÃ¥rdhs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302271,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103278,0003-6870,2021,103278,90,Applied Ergonomics,Cyclistsâ?? adaptation to a countdown timer to green traffic light: A before-after field study,article,NYGARDHS2021103278
"Background Infra-red and thermal imaging enable wireless systems to monitor patientsâ?? vital signs and absence of wires may improve patient experiences. No studies have explored staff perceptions of the concept of this specific type of technology in the adult population. Understanding existing working systems before introducing technology could improve adoption. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with Intensive Care Unit (ICU) staff exploring perceptions of wireless patient monitoring. We used the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model to guide thematic analysis. Results We identified usability themes relating to staff perceptions of current patient monitoring experiences, staff perceptions of patient/relative expectations of ICU care, troubleshooting, hierarchy of monitoring, and consensus of trust.

"Whole-Body Vibration (WBV) is an occupational hazard affecting employees working with transportation, construction or heavy machinery. To minimize vibration-induced pathologies, ISO identified WBV exposure limits based on vibration transmissibility and apparent mass studies. The ISO guidelines do not account for variations in posture or movement. In our study, we measured the transmissibility and apparent mass at the mouth, lower back, and leg of participants during stationary and propelled walking. Stationary walking transmissibility was significantly higher at the lumbar spine and bite bar at 5 and 10Â Hz compared to all higher frequencies while the distal tibia was lower at 5Â Hz compared to 10 and 15Â Hz. Propelled walking transmissibility was significantly higher at the bite bar and knee at 2Â Hz than all higher frequencies. These results vary from previously published transmissibility values for static participants, showing that ISO standards should be adjusted for active workers.","Whole-body vibrations, Walking, Transmissibility, Apparent mass",Delphine Chadefaux and Alex P.

"Musculoskeletal injuries of the lumbar spine occur frequently among military service members and are associated with heavy backpack loads. Musculoskeletal modeling and simulation facilitate biomechanical evaluation to compare different backpack designs. We developed a backpack attachment model that can be tuned to represent various load distributions between the torso and pelvis. We generated walking simulations to estimate muscle and joint contact forces of unloaded walking and while carrying 38 kg using shoulder-borne backpacks and hip belt-assisted backpacks for six U.S. Marines. Three-dimensional peak and average lumbar (L4-L5) and hip joint contact forces over the stance phase were compared between each load condition. Axial L4-L5 and axial and anterior hip joint contact forces were greater during both backpack conditions compared to the unloaded condition. Joint contact forces were similar between backpack conditions. Future studies incorporating additional participants, walking conditions, and backpack load distributions are suggested for further model development and backpack design evaluation.","Biomechanics, Locomotion, Musculoskeletal modeling, Back, Spine, Movement simulation, Load carriage",Jordan T.

"Discrepancies exist in backpack load recommendations for obese/overweight children, and the recommendations do not consider school trolleys. This study analysed obese/overweight and healthy-weight studentsâ?? perceived load and fatigue when carrying schoolbags and their gait kinematics and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) when carrying backpacks or pulling school trolleys with different loads. Twelve obese/overweight and 36 healthy-weight students were asked about their perceived load and fatigue in carrying their schoolbags to school. Then, a kinematic gait analysis was completed in students walking unloaded or transporting 10%, 15% or 20% of their bodyweight (BW) in a backpack or trolley. RPE was recorded after each condition. The average hip rotation and knee adduction angles differed between body mass index (BMI) groups. The healthy-weight group reported higher RPEs than the overweight/obese group when pulling a trolley with 10â??15% BW.

"Management of travelers' cognitive load is crucial for efficient information processing for optimal railway operations. We investigated variations in travelers' cognitive load with different expertise levels, in a field study. We aimed to assess the use of three eye metrics: pupil diameter, saccade amplitude and gaze of fixation duration for cognitive load analysis between expert and novice travelers in a Mass Transit train station: Saint-Michel Notre Dame. Physiological measures of emotional activity through skin conductance responses were also investigated, together with subjective measures of mental load using NASA-Task Load Index. Our results followed our expectations, where novice travelers expressed higher cognitive load than expert travelers, characterized by wider pupil diameter, larger amplitude of saccade and longer gaze duration, as well as higher electrodermal activity and NASA-TLX. Additional observations showed that experts used hierarchical and symmetrical scan paths, with more intense exposure on relevant information, characterized by brighter heat maps. This difference in behavior showed a clear difference in strategies for information retrieval at different expertise levels. Metrics of eye tracking device, together with electrodermal activity, proved to be potent in cognitive load analysis of train travelers, and helped to provide insights for real-life information processing.","Eye tracking, Cognitive load, Train travelers, Expertise, Eye metrics, Electrodermal activity",A.

"This study compared farmworkersâ?? exposure to non-neutral postures using a new mobile platform apple harvesting method and the traditional method using ladders. Twenty-four workers were recruited and assigned into three groups: ladder workers (nÂ = 8) picking apples from full trees using a ladder, mobile platform workers (nÂ = 8) picking apples from upper part of the trees while standing on a moving platform, and ground-based mobile platform workers (nÂ = 8) picking apples from lower part of the trees which the mobile platform workers left out. Upper arm and back inclinations were continuously monitored during harvesting using tri-axial accelerometers over full work shifts (~8Â h). Upper arm posture was characterized as the percentage of time that upper arm flexion and abduction exceeded 30Â°, 60Â°, and 90Â°. Back posture was characterized as the percentage of time that torso angles (sagittal flexion or lateral bending) exceeded 10Â°, 20Â°, and 30Â°. The 10th, 50th, and 90th postural percentiles were also calculated. The platform workers had lower exposures to upper arm flexion and abduction than the ground and ladder workers. There were no differences in torso angles between the ladder and mobile platform workers; however, the ground workers were exposed to more and greater percentages of time in torso flexions.",,Ornwipa Thamsuwan and Kit Galvin and Maria Tchong-French and Lovenoor Aulck and Linda Ng Boyle and Randal P.

"Objective To identify requirements for human-in-the-loop simulation capabilities and improve their utility in predicting and optimizing soldier-systems integration. Background Technological development rates within the military are rapidly increasing. Emergent technologies often exclude in-depth consideration of human-system interactions until the physical prototyping phase. Human-in-the-loop simulation tools can allow for earlier consideration of humans in the development process; however, use remains limited. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants to yield perspectives on current human-in-the-loop simulation capabilities and utility specific to the military. An inductive approach to thematic analysis was used to extract critical themes from transcribed interview data. A scoping review was completed to supplement the data obtained from interviews and summarize knowledge regarding requirements for human-in-the-loop simulation and analysis capabilities targeted to the military. Results Interviews were conducted with five experts representing the sectors of Vehicle/Equipment Design, Simulation, and Army Research. A total of 2274 sources were identified, and 64 papers were retained for the scoping review. Thematic analysis of the combined data sources yielded six important themes to consider with respect to requirements for future human-in-the-loop simulation capabilities targeting soldier-systems integration. Conclusion This study has identified eight key requirements to support the use of human-in-the-loop simulation tools to predict and optimize soldier-systems integration and performance. Application Addressing key requirements will improve the ability of current human-in-the-loop simulation tools to accommodate the military's need for human consideration early in the design process.","Simulation and virtual reality, Human-systems integration, Human performance modelling, Prototyping, Anthropometry",Justin B.

"We report an organization's method for recruiting additional, specialized human resources during anomaly handling. The method has been tailored to encourage sharing adaptive capacity across organizational units. As predicted by Woods' theory, this case shows that sharing adaptive capacity allows graceful extensibility that is particularly useful when a system is challenged by frequent but unpredictably severe events. We propose that (1) the ability to borrow adaptive capacity from other units is a hallmark of resilient systems and (2) the deliberate adjustment adaptive capacity sharing is a feature of some forms of resilience engineering. Some features of this domain that may lead to discovery of resilience and promote resilience engineering in other settings, notably hospital emergency rooms.","Resilience, Resilience engineering, Graceful extensibility",Richard I.

"In real life, many objects catch our attention involuntarily or exogenously. Exogenous attention occurs fast and its effects are short-lived. In the laboratory, when attentional orientation is studied, both valid and invalid attentional signals are used: the valid ones direct the attention to a location where something relevant is going to appear. The invalid ones occur in a location where nothing relevant is going to happen. Usually, performance is improved when valid signals rather than invalid ones are presented. This work is novel in that it explores the effects of attentional capture and driving experience in situations of day-to-day driving while participants carry out a Hazard Prediction task. We created new Hazard Prediction (HPr) and Risk Estimation (RE) tests when driving by selecting 48 short videos recorded in a realistic way from the perspective of a car driver. We created valid and invalid trials by selecting videos in which a what?? was presented in the same spatial location as the one where the hazard was beginning to develop or in a different location. Simple situations, with only one developing hazard, were also presented. A total of 92 participants (30 experienced drivers, 32 novices and 30 with no experience) were placed in the position of the driver and answered the questions: 1) What will happen after the video is cut? 2) To what extent do you consider this situation risky? The results from the Hazard Prediction test replicate the attentional capture effect in complex driving situations, with invalid trials obtaining the worst results, followed by valid and simple ones. Participants with experience obtained better scores than novices, and novices were better than drivers without experience. No interaction between attentional orientation and experience was found, suggesting the obligatory and automatic nature of orientation processes, which do not appear to be compensated for by driving experience. No significant differences were found for the Risk Estimation test.","Hazard perception, Exogenous orienting, Driving experience, Risk estimation, Risk decision making",Ismael Muela and Ana B.

"Twenty participants (18 males and 2 females) completed postural stability assessments before and after 4-h exposure to whole body vibration (WBV) in four experimental conditions: (a) vertical-dominant WBV with vertical passive air suspension, (b) multi-axial WBV with vertical passive air suspension, (c) multi-axial WBV with multi-axial active suspension, and (d) no WBV condition. Center of pressure (COP)-based postural sway measures significantly increased following multi-axial WBV exposure. Increase in COP velocity and displacement following multi-axial WBV was significantly higher than the increase in all the other exposure conditions. However, no significant differences between the WBV conditions were observed in functional limits of stability and anticipatory postural adjustments. While our results show standing balance to be impaired following the multi-axial WBV exposure of off-road mining vehicles, dynamic stability across a broader range of conditions needs to be understood to causally link postural stability decrements to increased fall-risks associated with off-road vehicle operators.","Whole-body vibration, Mining vehicle, Postural balance",Jang-Ho Park and Kiana Kia and Divya Srinivasan and Jeong Ho Kim,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020302556,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103307,0003-6870,2021,103307,91,Applied Ergonomics,Postural balance effects from exposure to multi-axial whole-body vibration in mining vehicle operation,article,PARK2021103307
"Gibson and Crooks (1938) argued that a â??field of safe travelâ?? could qualitatively explain drivers' steering behavior on straights, curved roads, and while avoiding obstacles. This study aims to quantitatively explain driver behavior while avoiding obstacles on a straight road, and quantify the â??Driver's Risk Fieldâ?? (DRF). In a fixed-based driving simulator, 77 (7 longitudinal and 11 lateral) positions of the obstacles were used to quantify the subjectively perceived and objectively (maximum absolute steering angle) measured DRF for eight participants. The subjective response was a numerical answer to the question â??How much steering do you think you need at this moment in time?â? The results show that the propagation of the width of the DRF, along the longitudinal distance, resembled an hourglass shape, and all participants responded to obstacles that were placed beyond the width of the car. This implies that the Driver's Risk Field is wider than the car width.","Field of safe travel, Risk, Obstacle avoidance, Potential field, Driving",Sarvesh Kolekar and Joost {de Winter} and David Abbink,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018307373,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103196,0003-6870,2020,103196,89,Applied Ergonomics,Which parts of the road guide obstacle avoidance?

"Decision-making during critical outbreak management may require standard strategies, but also more creative ones. Our goal was to characterize the expert decision processes that take place during critical situations, where rule-based strategies and usual procedures cannot be satisfactorily applied. More specifically, we focused on the strategies experts use to deal with epidemiological problems, depending on the complexity of the situation. To this end, we carried out a simulated outbreak alert, to place two experts in a situation of epidemiological problem management, based on usual practice but also conducive to implementing creative solutions. To analyze the data, we considered not only the relevance of the solutions proposed by the experts, but also the four creativity criteria defined by Torrance (fluency, flexibility, elaboration and originality).

"The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of prolonged seated work, lift task, age and sex on normalized lumbar angles, thoracic angles, perceived effort and duration of lifts. A total of 17 young and 17 mature participants were recruited with an average (standard deviation) age of 23.8 (5.0) years and 63.7 (3.9) years, respectively. Participants completed 3 different floor to knuckle lifts before and following 90Â min of seated work. The lifts included; (i) 7Â kg symmetrical, (ii) 4.5Â kg symmetrical and (iii) 4.5Â kg asymmetrical. Prolonged seated work and age interacted to affect normalized peak lumbar angles (pÂ =Â 0.0469) where older adults adopted 56(15)% flexion after seated work compared to 67(16)% among younger adults. Older adults took significantly longer to complete the lifting tasks compared to younger adults while age did not affect perceived effort across lifting tasks.

"Many studies of ballpoint pens have been conducted. However, those studies have not considered the emotional factors that can enhance user experience. Styluses resemble ballpoint pens in many ways, which are widely available in a variety of styles. Therefore, in the present study, we explored the physical and emotional attributes that improve user satisfaction with typical ballpoint pens, with the goal of also understanding what factors might be important for stylus design. First, 14 emotional factors associated with the pens were derived. Second, 16 different types of ball-point pens were measured for six physical properties. Then, an experiment was performed to assess user satisfaction and emotional factors for pens. The House of Quality (HOQ) was used to obtain the chief physical properties. Results showed that to increase user satisfaction it is necessary to make pens be comfortable, fine, refined, deep, and natural. Also, we found that for high user satisfaction pens need to be heavier and longer, have thick and antislip grips and thin nibs, and their center of gravity should be located close to the nib to increase user satisfaction.","Ballpoint pens, Styluses, Emotion, House of quality, User experience",Kyungdoh Kim and Robert W.

"Many factors affect the comfort of automotive seats including pressure distribution, vibration, temperature, and backrest inclination. However, one aspect of seating that has not been well studied is leg splay; splay is a rotation at the hips which causes the knees to move outward. The work presented here identified the ranges of â??comfortableâ? splay in different styles of seats and related changes in seating pressure due to leg splay. Sixteen midsized male participants were tested in six seats: a flat control, three mid-sized sedan, a sports car, and a pickup truck. Participants sat with two leg conditions: 1) shoulder width apart and 2) rotating their legs to splay to a self-identified, comfortable position. For each test, the participant placed his left leg on a foot support and right leg on a depressible pedal to mimic a driving position. In each posture, leg angle and seat pan pressures were collected. Of the seats tested, the flat wooden seat had the highest possible splay (24.5Â°). The three sedan seats had similar splay angles (16.1â??18.5Â°). The lowest splay values were in the sports car seat (8.96Â°) and truck seat (7.46Â°). This reduction in splay was attributed to the more aggressive bolsters in the sports car and a higher seat design position in the pickup truck seat. Following participant splay the pressures in the seat bolsters increased while the pressure in the left thigh and left buttocks regions decreased. By determining the comfortable ranges of splay and how pressure distribution is affected, seat designers and automobile manufacturers can use these data when evaluating seat designs and occupant positioning.","Automotive, Comfort, Seating",Joshua P.

"Thermal comfort modeling has been of interest in built environment research for decades. Mostly the modeling approaches focused on an average response of a large group of building occupants. Recently, the focus has been shifted towards personal comfort models that predict individuals' thermal comfort responses. Currently, thermal comfort responses are collected from the occupants via survey. This study explored if the thermal comfort of individuals could be predicted using machine learning algorithms while relaying on the set of collected inputs from an experiment. The model was developed using experimental data including collected from a previously performed experiment in the climate chamber. Two different approaches based on the output data (thermal sensation and thermal comfort votes) and five different sets of input variables were explored. The algorithms tested were Support Vector Machine with four different Kernel functions (Linear, Quadratic, Cubic and Gaussian) and Ensemble Algorithms (Boosted trees, Bagged trees and RUSBoosted trees). The combination of occupants' heating behavior with a personal comfort system (PCS), skin temperatures, time and environmental data were used for the development of personal comfort models to predict individuals' thermal preference. The study investigated the novel combination of inputs such as the use of skin temperature and settings of the personalized heating system as parameters in predicting personal thermal comfort. The results showed that personal comfort models among all tested approaches and subjects showed the best median accuracy of 0.84 using RUSBoosted trees. Individually looking, the approach using thermal sensation output produced better prediction accuracy. On the other hand, the models based on inputs that consisted of PCS control behavior and mean and hand skin temperatures produced the best prediction accuracy when assessing all tested algorithms. The main limitation of the study is the number of test subjects, and further recommendation is to perform more experiments.","Personal comfort model, Thermal comfort, Machine learning, Skin temperature, Personalized heating system",Katarina KatiÄ? and Rongling Li and Wim Zeiler,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018305763,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103078,0003-6870,2020,103078,85,Applied Ergonomics,Machine learning algorithms applied to a prediction of personal overall thermal comfort using skin temperatures and occupants' heating behavior,article,KATIC2020103078

We bridge this gap by using an electroencephalography metric derived from frontal midline theta power and parietal alpha power, known as the task load index, to determine if cognitive effort measured at the level of cortical activity is less when cognitive fit is present compared to when cognitive fit is not. We found that when there is cognitive fit between the type of problem to be solved and the information displayed by a system, the task load index is lower compared to when cognitive fit is not present. We support this finding with subjective (NASA task load index) and performance (response time and accuracy) measures. Our approach, using electroencephalography, provides supplemental information to self-report and performance measures. Findings from this study are important because they (1) provide more validity to the cognitive fit theory using a neurophysiological measure, and (2) use the electroencephalography task load index metric as a means to assess cognitive workload and effort in general.","Cognitive fit theory, Visualization, Electroencephalography",Joseph K.

"This work examines how tactile cues, encoded with azimuth and distance information, compare with visual and speech cues on performance and mental workload in a target detection task. Two experiments are reported using a simulated environment in which targets were presented at varying azimuth and distance locations. In the first experiment, participants engaged targets both while stationary and while in motion using tactile, visual, or speech cues. A no cueing control was included. In the second multi-modal experiment, participants completed the same task using cue pairings. Performance metrics consisted of hits, misses due to non-detection, misses due to inaccurate engagement, false alarms, response time, navigation errors as well as subjective ratings of mental workload scores were also collected. Results demonstrate the superiority of tactile cues as a means to communicate target location information either as a single modality or when paired with the two other cue types.","Tactile, Multimodal, Dismounted",Timothy L.

"From an ergonomics perspective, the environmental characteristics should facilitate user activities. Matching user capabilities to demands of the environment is essential. However, about some users such as those with visual impairments, there is little information available for use in designing products and spaces. There is also a gap in information regarding the commutes and needs of the visually impaired, making it even more difficult to establish how environments should be designed to include this population.This study aimed to identify the information needs of people with visual impairment in terms of: 1) Daily life activities, 2) Wayfinding in the complex built environments, 3) Use of the signals provided by the environment 4) Characteristics of the environment which reduce the usability of a space and may put the user in danger, and 5) Safety perception. Data were obtained through a semi-structured interview to which eighteen adults responded. All had either complete blindness or severe visual impairment. For orientation, the most common references were texture or changes in ground level/surface, along with such ambient elements as noise or smells. Information presented in Braille was reported as little used, due to difficulty in finding such information. Regarding safety, participants reported feeling unsafe; most mentioned crossing the street as a major risk. Using auditory, tactile or even olfactory signals may provide important information while commuting: thus, designing signals which consider and highlight these senses is paramount. Assessing features and location of existing tactile signals is also required, to identify opportunities for improving the safety and independence of people with visual impairment.","Visual impairment, Information resources, Information design, Environmental ergonomics",John A.

"Workers in hospitals, clinics, and contract research organizations who repetitively use syringes have an increased risk for musculoskeletal disorders. This study developed and tested a novel syringe adapter designed to reduce muscle strain associated with repetitive fluid draws. Three syringe plunger extension methods (ring-finger, middle-finger, and syringe adapter) were studied across twenty participants. Electromyogram signals for the flexor digitorum superficialis and extensor digitorum muscles were recorded. The syringe adapter required 31% of the 90th percentile flexor muscle activity as compared to the ring-finger syringe extension method, and 45% the 90th percentile flexor muscle activity as compared to the middle-finger method (pÂ <Â 0.001). The greatest differences were observed when the syringe was near full extension. Although the syringe adapter took more time than the other syringe extension methods (1.5 times greater), it greatly helped reduce physical stress associated with repetitive, awkward syringe procedures.","Healthcare workers, Ergonomic tools, Musculoskeletal disorders",Joseph Ulbrich and Robert Swader and George Petry and Benjamin L.

"Systems contradictions present challenges that need to be effectively managed, e.g. due to conflicting rules and advice, goal conflicts, and mismatches between demand and capacity. We apply FRAM (Functional Resonance Analysis Method) to intravenous infusion practices in an intensive care unit (ICU) to explore how tensions and contradictions are managed by people. A multi-disciplinary team including individuals from nursing, medical, pharmacy, safety, IT and human factors backgrounds contributed to this analysis. A FRAM model investigation resulting in seven functional areas are described. A tabular analysis highlights significant areas of performance variability, e.g. administering medication before a prescription, prioritising drugs, different degrees of double checking and using sites showing early signs of infection for intravenous access. Our FRAM analysis has been non-normative: performance variability is not necessarily wanted or unwanted, it is merely necessary where system contradictions cannot be easily resolved and so adaptive capacity is required to cope.","FRAM, Infusion, Critical care",Dominic Furniss and David Nelson and Ibrahim Habli and Sean White and Matthew Elliott and Nick Reynolds and Mark Sujan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300740,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103113,0003-6870,2020,103113,86,Applied Ergonomics,Using FRAM to explore sources of performance variability in intravenous infusion administration in ICU: A non-normative approach to systems contradictions,article,FURNISS2020103113
"The prevalence of musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms in radiographers is high, similar to other healthcare occupations that involve high levels of physical exertion (e.g. patient handling; grasping and moving equipment). Reports of interventions to reduce MSK discomfort in radiographers are limited. A participatory approach was used to investigate daily challenges, needs, and opportunities for developing interventions to address exposures to many of the risk factors that contribute to MSK symptoms in radiographers. In this paper, we present the expressed needs of experienced radiographers (including assistance with patient handling, security, supportive design of equipment and work spaces), along with their evaluations of several intervention concepts intended to address some of those needs. We also report results from tests of three prototype interventions stemming from this participatory process that demonstrate the potential for new engineering control concepts to reduce the physical effort associated with some of the most common tasks radiographers perform.","Musculoskeletal injury, Intervention design, Healthcare",Carolyn M.

"Thirty million Americans currently have diabetes, and a substantial portion do not reach the goals of clinical treatment. This is in part due to the complex barriers to effective self-care faced by people with diabetes. This study uses a patient work perspective, focusing on the everyday, lived experience of managing diabetes. Our primary research goal was to explore how the work of self-care is embedded in the other routines of everyday living. We found that everyday objects and spaces were instrumental in the incorporation of diabetes work into daily routines. Objects anchored diabetes tasks by linking illness-specific artifacts to space and time (e.g. a morning routine), and by enabling the performance on diabetes tasks while on the move in either planned or unplanned ways.","Patient work, Affordance, Resilience",Laurie Lovett Novak and Howard B.A. Baum and Margaret H.

"Despite recent concerns for workersâ?? health, exposure situations to nanoparticles can occur in numerous workplaces. Understanding how exposures occur considering human work in these transformations remains a crucial issue of nanotechnologies. The objective of this article is to understand exposure situations to nanoparticles, their determinants and the resources to act on them. This understanding was achieved by specific measurement of nanoparticles aerosols, combined with an analysis of work activity (actions performed and physical strain) in a rubber industry. The presentation of real time measurements, associated with the video of work situations, during confrontation interviews becomes a means of making exposing work activities visible, to analyze and transform them from the points of view formulated by the company's stakeholders. In this way, characterized â??typical exposure situationsâ? serve to trigger discussions and open up new spaces for debate highlighting how innovation affects work and gives rise to enhanced prevention projects.","Design project, Participatory ergonomics, Measurement, Nanotechnologies",Louis Galey and Sabyne Audignon and Olivier Witschger and SÃ©bastien Bau and Nathalie Judon and Aude Lacourt and Alain Garrigou,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018305647,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103116,0003-6870,2020,103116,87,Applied Ergonomics,What does ergonomics have to do with nanotechnologies?

"How do complex healthcare systems that are organised into distinct speciality areas achieve effective patient care transitions when patients present with a rare constellation of symptoms that affect multiple body systems? How do these patients challenge existing ways of organising tasks, clinical activities, and interdependent responsibilities? The current study applies a sociotechnical systems perspective to understand how these complex work design and care-related challenges were resolved by the Western Australian Undiagnosed Diseases Program. We conducted a two-year longitudinal, qualitative study of this program, conceived to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with rare, multi-system disorders by piloting a re-design of the local system of diagnostic work. Specifically, we (1) compared the configuration and effectiveness of the old system and the re-designed system; and (2) analysed the process of system re-design (i.e., the design, implementation, and operation of the program) in order to understand the factors that contributed to â?? or inhibited â?? its success. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings for effectively re-designing complex, trans-organisational work systems.","Sociotechnical systems, Work design, Work re-design, Healthcare",Georgia J.

"The aim of this study was to compare the application of different warp knitted spacer fabrics on a car seat shell to a standard seat in terms of vertical seat transmissibility. Furthermore, the results obtained by human subject tests were compared to results of an anthropodynamic dummy test. Experiments were conducted on a vertically actuated platform under laboratory conditions with 16 human subjects and an anthropodynamic dummy. Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility of the seat pan and the seat backrest were calculated to evaluate ride quality. Seat transmissibility ranged between 73.6% for backrest and 177.7% for pan. Based on the results of statistical tests, the hypothesis that the transmissibility of a seat would be influenced by seat cushion conditions was accepted (pÂ <Â 0.05). It was also shown that an anthropodynamic dummy test could replace tests with human subjects (r2Â =Â 0.907) if the target population was matched sufficiently.","Anthropodynamic dummy, Vibration, Automotive",Dominik Krumm and Stefan Schwanitz and Stephan Odenwald,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300624,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103099,0003-6870,2020,103099,86,Applied Ergonomics,Seat cushions made of warp knitted spacer fabrics influence seat transmissibility,article,KRUMM2020103099
"We developed a new kit to assemble three-dimensional (3D) tactile maps for orientation and mobility (O&M) training provided to persons with visual impairments. This study evaluated the effects of verbal explanations combined with 3D tactile map kits in improving understanding, recall, and walking along an unfamiliar route in comparison with the effects of only verbal explanation. The 3D tactile maps provided participants having severe visual impairments and little experience with tactile maps with a better understanding and recall of the environmental information concerning the route and landmarks. Participants who used the 3D tactile maps could find specific landmarks set as tasks more accurately and arrive at the destination alone getting lost less frequently. Tactile maps composed of 3D points, lines, and areal parts are useful as a support aid for O&M training because they have high tactile readability and can provide the environmental information that individuals with visual impairment require.","Visual impairment, Orientation and mobility, Tactile map",Wataru Toyoda and Eiji Tani and Susumu Oouchi and Masaki Ogata,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301319,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103177,0003-6870,2020,103177,88,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of environmental explanation using three-dimensional tactile maps for orientation and mobility training,article,TOYODA2020103177
"Care transitions across healthcare settings, specifically between the emergency department (ED) and the home, are pervasive among older adults, and represent persistent healthcare quality and safety challenges. Care transitions cross multiple distinct work systems, representing a conceptual and methodological challenge for the field of Human Factors/Ergonomics - how to analyze a process that occurs across multiple work systems. As an initial step in determining how to study care transitions across work systems, we applied the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) 2.0 model, specifically the concept of configuration, to explore older adults' ED-to-home transitions. Our results suggest that configuration is useful for identifying and modeling work system barriers that interact across systems, but does not explicitly allow for the identification and analysis of the system boundaries that are crossed. To fully capture the complexity associated with care transitions, future iterations of SEIPS should introduce a mechanism to capture specific boundary types, so that system analysis can capture when and which boundaries are crossed.","Care transitions, Work systems, Sociotechnical systems, Older adults, Emergency department",Nicole E.

"This study explores the relationship between seat pitch and comfort, and the influencing factors, like space experience and anthropometric measurements. Two hundred ninety-four participants experienced economy class seats in a Boeing 737 with 28-inch, 30-inch, 32-inch and 34-inch seat pitches. Anthropometric measurements of the participants were measured. Participants completed a questionnaire on comfort (10-scale), discomfort (CP-50) and space experience and the results were analysed using SPSS 25. This study showed a significant relationship between seat pitch and comfort as well as discomfort. Additionally, it was found that the mean rank of discomfort of each pitch size for the middle seat was higher than the window and aisle seat, though seat pitch did affect the (dis)comfort more compared with seat location. It was also found that anthropometric sizes significantly affect the (dis)comfort on smaller pitch sizes, and all space experience questions had a correlation to the pitch sizes.","Seat pitch, Comfort, Discomfort, Space experience, Anthropometric measurements",Shabila Anjani and Wenhua Li and Iemkje A.

"Technological developments present diverse opportunities to modernise services for the rail industry. Systems can be implemented to improve passengersâ?? experiences, but these may also affect the experiences of crew working on board trains. This first-of-a-kind research extends the concept of customer journey mapping as a design tool to understand the experiences of train crew. To produce these crew journey maps, interviews and user observation methods were adopted (NÂ =Â 22). Results show that two main negative touchpoints for the crew occur at the platform-train interface and during revenue protection activities. This paper presents an innovative methodological contribution around journey mapping to better understand rail experiences, but revolving around the crew rather than the expected consumer experience.

"This paper: identifies personal and contextual factors that influence customer experience when service failures occur in rail transport; what is being conveyed through that factor (e.g. older age being used to convey vulnerability); and the implications for future service design. The results are from a thematic analysis of free-text rail passenger complaints (nÂ =Â 516) reporting service failures that impacted on customer experience. The study differs from existing research on the pertinent personal and contextual factors for public transport service provision in that it: focuses on the passenger experience resulting from specific incidents (rather than evaluative, overall assessments of satisfaction), generates the factors inductively from the data (rather than a-priori) and uses detailed qualitative cases (rather than quantitative survey data). The findings (1) identify some similar factors to those used in previous research and uncover some new factors for both person and context, (2) provide an understanding of what they mean in terms of the passenger experience and (3) indicate how the factors might need to be measured if they are to be used by the rail industry. The paper concludes by using the outcome of an industry-based validation exercise to describe how the findings could be used in future rail services, namely: predicting where the customer experience is going to be sub-optimal, prioritising responses to particular circumstances, and designing services to better meet customer's needs. This exploratory research is timely, given the need for a more passenger-centric approach to service design and future developments such as smart-ticketing, which could potentially enable greater understanding of who is using the rail network and for what journeys.","Service design, Rail transit, Customer experience",Tracy Ross and Andrew May and Stuart A.

"Emergency escape roof hatches are used to evacuate school buses in rolled-over orientations. In the United States, the minimum opening size of a roof hatch is defined by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) no. 217. With the prevalence of rising obesity rates among children, the minimum roof hatch opening size may not be large enough to accommodate larger passengers. Post-accident conditions such as injuries, disorientation, and exit obstructions may also prevent unobstructed passage for egress within acceptable time limits. The purpose of this study was to redesign and fabricate a roof hatch with a larger opening and evaluate its egress characteristics for a range of typical school bus passengers. The larger roof hatch opening allows greater evacuation flow rates, and is almost functionally equivalent to the evacuation flow rate of the front door on an upright school bus.","Accident, Roll-over, Evacuation, School bus, Surface transportation, Students, Emergency exits",Leslie Gunter and Jerry Davis and Yousif Abulhassan and Richard Sesek and Mark Schall and Sean Gallagher,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301320,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103178,0003-6870,2020,103178,88,Applied Ergonomics,Increasing evacuation flow through school bus emergency roof hatches,article,GUNTER2020103178
"Laparoscopic surgery techniques are customarily used in non-invasive procedures. That said traditional surgical instruments and devices used by surgeons suffer from certain ergonomic deficiencies that may lead to physical complaints in upper limbs and back and general discomfort that may, in turn, affect the surgeonâ??s skills during surgery. A novel design of the laparoscopic gripper handle is presented and compared with one of the most used instruments in this field in an attempt to overcome this problem. The assessment of the ergonomic feature of the novel design was performed by using timeâ??frequency analysis of the surface electromyography (sEMG) signal during dynamic activities. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) was used to decompose the sEMG signal and extract the median frequency of each muscle to assess muscle fatigue. The results reveal that using the proposed ergonomic grip reduces the mean values of the muscle activity during each of the proposed tasks. The novel design also improves the ease of use in laparoscopic surgery as it minimises high-pressure contact areas, reduces large amplitude movements and promotes a neutral position of the hand, wrist and forearm. Furthermore, the SSA method for timeâ??frequency analysis provides a powerful tool to analyse a prescribed activity in ergonomic terms. The proposed methodology to assess muscle activity during surgery activities may be useful in the selection of surgical instruments when programming extended procedures, as it provides an additional selection criterion based on the surgeonâ??s biomechanics and the proposed activity.","Ergonomic assessment, Minimally invasive surgery, Surface electromyography signals, timeâ??frequency analysis, Singular spectrum analysis",A.G.

"In this paper a measurement tool is described and tested to evaluate the characteristics of different elements of a seat. Many studies report a relationship between discomfort and pressure distribution, but it is unknown what exactly is happening in the interaction. The purpose of this study is to present a measuring device, which records the comfort relevant seat parameters pressure and elongation while loading a seat. The results of the study, including the repeatability, reproducibility and detectability show that the measurement method is appropriate for our purpose, although the reproducibility has to be improved by operator experience or by a more intuitive assembling of the measurement setup. An application example illustrates that the interaction of the seat components highly affect the resulting comfort relevant parameters. The question is whether this objectively recorded differences are also experienced by seat occupants, which is interesting to study in future research.","Measurement method, Objective seat comfort, Seat characterization, Comfort relevant parameter",M.

"There is a growing need for resilience in dealing with unexpected events during disasters. The purpose of this review was to summarize and synthesize the literature that examined resilience in the context of emergency management (EM). Four groups of findings were synthesized: definitions, key dimensions, technical tools, and research settings employed in the research. First, definitions of resilience, improvisation, and adaptation were summarized and critically evaluated. Second, four key dimensions of EM resilience were identified: collective sensemaking, team decision making, harmonizing work-as-imagined and work-as-done, and interaction and coordination. Third, this review identified five prevalent technical tools used to enhance resilience in EM: mapmaking, event history logging, mobile communication applications, integrated information management system, and decision support tools. Fourth, two major design features of emergency simulations, incident scenarios and participant roles, are evaluated. For each finding, directions for future research efforts to improve resilience in EM are proposed.","Resilience engineering, Emergency response, Systematic review, System safety",Changwon Son and Farzan Sasangohar and Timothy Neville and S.

"Informal caregivers are an integral part of care delivery for persons with dementia (PwD). Informal caregivers take part in a wide range of care activities both individually and collaboratively with other caregivers. Caregiving often involves high demands in the face of limited resources, which can lead to stress, burden, and burnout. To support caregivers, we need to conceptualize caregiving activities they perform, and the networks and roles through which they perform work. We performed a directed content analysis on interview data from twenty caregivers and applied a human factors approach to characterize informal caregiving work. Our results revealed 1) nuances in caregiving roles, 2) differences in caregiving networks, and 3) 13 categories of caregiving activities characterized by time commitments; physical, cognitive and socio-behavioral demands; and varying network dependencies. These findings can be applied in future studies to evaluate the needs of caregiving networks and how to better support them.","Patient work, Dementia caregiving, Human factors engineering",Siddarth Ponnala and Laura Block and Aloysius J.

"Individuals can coordinate small kinematic changes at several degrees of freedom simultaneously in the presence of fatigue, leaving it unclear how overall biomechanical demands at each joint are altered. The purpose of this study was to evaluate trade-offs in joint moments between the trunk, shoulder, and elbow during repetitive upper extremity work. Participants performed four simulated workplace tasks cyclically until meeting fatigue termination criteria. Emergent fatigue-induced adaptations to repetitive work resulted in task-dependent trade-offs in joint moments. In general, reduced shoulder moments were compensated for by increased elbow and trunk joint moment contributions. Although mean joint moment changes were modest (range: 1â??3 Nm) across participants, a wide distribution of responses was observed, with standard deviations exceeding 10 Nm. Re-distributing biomechanical demands across joints may alleviate constant tissue loads and facilitate continued task performance with fatigue but may be at the expense of increasing demands at adjacent joints.","Fatigue, Shoulder, Variability",Daanish M.

"Phishing is a social engineering tactic where a malicious actor impersonates a trustworthy third party with the intention of tricking the user into divulging sensitive information. Previous social engineering research in a real-world setting has shown an interaction between the personality of the target and the persuasion principle used. This study investigated whether this interaction is present in the realm of email phishing. Additionally, a signal detection theory framework was used to evaluate how the various persuasion principles influence accuracy, sensitivity (dâ??), and response criterion placement. A personality inventory and an email identification task (phishing or legitimate) were used. These data support previous findings that high extroversion is predictive of increased susceptibility to phishing attacks. The various persuasions principles elicited diverse response criterions and sensitivities, though all investigated persuasion principles resulted in a liberal decision criterion, except one. These findings are interpreted and discussed.","Phishing, Cybersecurity, Susceptibility, Signal detection, Persuasion principle, Personality",Patrick Lawson and Carl J.

"Improving vibration-induced discomfort often requires a reduction in the vibration experienced by vehicle occupants. Simulation software and test equipment are able to measure changes in vibration that are too small for humans to perceive. It is therefore important to know how large the change in vibration should be, i.e. the difference threshold, for occupants to perceive an improvement in comfort. This study estimates difference thresholds for ten automotive engineers seated in a vehicle on a 4-poster test rig. Participants were exposed to multi-axis vibration. Component ride values were calculated by applying BS 6841 frequency weightings and multiplication factors to seat accelerations in the six directions. Difference thresholds were estimated for two road profiles using the vertical component ride value and combined point ride value (i.e. the root-sums-of-squares of the six component ride values). The two road profiles had different magnitudes, but the same spectral shape, resulting in median vertical component ride values of 0.58 and 1.01 m.s.â??2, root-mean-square. An up-down transformed response rule was used with a three-down-one-up response grouping to estimate difference thresholds at a 79.4% probability level. The median relative difference threshold for the two roads was 10.13% and 8.58% considering the vertical component ride value, and 10.99% and 9.24% considering the combined point ride value. No statistically significant difference was found between the medians of the relative difference threshold over the two roads considering either of the two ride values (p-valueÂ =Â 0.995 in both instances), suggesting that Weber's law holds.","Difference threshold, Whole-body vibration, Multi-axis vibration, Vibration-induced discomfort, Ride comfort",Roland Peter GrÃ¤be and Cor-Jacques Kat and Paul {Jacobus van Staden} and Pieter Schalk Els,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018303004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103115,0003-6870,2020,103115,87,Applied Ergonomics,Difference thresholds for a vehicle on a 4-poster test rig,article,GRABE2020103115
"The built environment is a core part of most healthcare systems, involving a number of requirements such as those related to space and patientsâ?? well-being. However, these are usually addressed separately from other functional requirements, resulting in designs that do not support resilient performance. This study proposes a framework for the integrated modelling of built environment and other functional requirements, relying on two approaches: Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM), and Building Information Modelling (BIM). Requirements are defined as equivalent to the precondition aspect of FRAM functions. BIM allows the creation of a database of requirements and functions, linked to an object-oriented model of the built environment. The proposed framework was devised and tested in an intensive care unit. Findings shed light on the necessary resilience to cope with the gap between built environment-as-imagined in design and built environment-as-done due to performance adjustments. This type of resilience may have a long-lasting nature, as many built environment attributes cannot be easily changed.","Built environment, Resilience engineering, Intensive care unit, Requirements management",NatÃ¡lia Ransolin and Tarcisio Abreu Saurin and Carlos Torres Formoso,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301095,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103154,0003-6870,2020,103154,88,Applied Ergonomics,Integrated modelling of built environment and functional requirements: Implications for resilience,article,RANSOLIN2020103154

"Personas can be used to understand patterns of variation in patientsâ?? performance of cognitive work, particularly self-care decision making. In this study, we used a patient-centered cognitive task analysis (P-CTA) to develop self-care decision-making personas. We collected data from 24 older adults with chronic heart failure and 14 support persons, using critical incident and fictitious scenario interviews. Qualitative analyses produced three personas but revealed that individuals exemplify different personas across situations. The Rule-Following persona seeks clear rules, exercises caution under uncertainty, and grounds actions in confidence in clinician experts. The Researching persona seeks information to gain better understanding, invents strategies, and conducts experiments independently or with clinicians. The Disengaging persona does not actively seek rules or information and does not attempt to reduce uncertainty or conduct experiments. We discuss the situational nature of personas, their use in design, and the benefits of P-CTA for studying patient decision making.","Naturalistic decision making, Patient ergonomics and human factors, Cognitive task analysis, Chronic heart failure (CHF), User-centered design, Critical incident technique, Personas",Richard J.

"Introduction The period following discharge can present risks for older adults. Most research has focused on hospital discharge with less attention paid to on-going care needs. Despite evidence that patients undertake â??invisible workâ?? to improve care safety, their reported willingness to be involved in care, and the consensus that successful transitions interventions include patient involvement, in reality, this is variable. Further, little research has viewed transitional care as a â??systemâ??, with gaps, interdependencies and variability across settings, nor the role of patients and families in supporting the system resilience. Research objectives 1) model transitional care from multiple perspectives using the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM); 2) use the model to develop a theory of change to support intervention development. Method We drew data from two studies: i) exploring the perspective of older adults across transitional care, and ii) exploring how health services experience transitional care. We employed the FRAM to develop a model of transitional care, with a system boundary spanning an older patient's admission to hospital, through to thirty days post-discharge. Findings Modelling transitional care from multiple perspectives was challenging. 27 functions were identified with interdependencies between hospital-based functions and patient-led functions once home, the success of which may impact on transitions â??outcomesâ?? (e.g. safety events, readmissions). The model supported development of a theory of change, to guide future intervention development. Conclusions Supporting certain patient-facing upstream hospital functions (e.g. encouraging mobility, supporting a better understanding of medication and condition), may lead to improved outcomes for patients following hospital discharge.","Functional Resonance Analysis Method, Transitional care, Transitions, Resilience engineering, Safety II, Patient involvement, Hospital discharge",Jane K.

"We compared two backpack designs (back/front or back only) in twelve recreational runners (age 22.0Â Â±Â 1.7years). An initial incremental exercise test (VO2max 52.2Â Â±Â 4.7Â mlÂ kgâ??1.minâ??1) was conducted, followed by four tests of 20Â min duration (running speed 9.8Â Â±Â 1.1Â km/h) with loads carried of 0, 1Â kg, 3Â kg, and 6Â kg with the two backpack designs in a randomized order. Economy was assessed by energy cost of running (CR), oxygen cost (O2 cost), heart rate (HR) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE). Repeated measure ANOVA revealed a non-significant main effect for CR, O2 cost, HR, RPE between systems. Post-hoc comparison of significant timeÂ Ã?Â position interaction showed for CR, F(3,33)Â =Â 5.34, pÂ <Â .01, Î·p2Â =Â 0.33, and O2 cost, F(3,33)Â =Â 5.15, pÂ <Â .01, Î·p2Â =Â 0.32, that carrying weight in the back/front were significantly lower after 20Â min (CR: pÂ =Â .02 and O2 cost: pÂ =Â .03).

"For health information technology to realize its potential to improve flow, care, and patient safety, applications should be intuitive to use and burden neutral for frontline clinicians. We assessed the impact of a patient safety dashboard on clinician cognitive and work load within a simulated information-seeking task for safe inpatient opioid medication management. Compared to use of an electronic health record for the same task, the dashboard was associated with significantly reduced time on task, mouse clicks, and mouse movement (each pÂ <Â 0.001), with no significant increases in cognitive load nor task inaccuracy. Cognitive burden was higher for users with less experience, possibly partly attributable to usability issues identified during this study.

"Pushing and pulling wheeled objects represent a significant part of manual material handling activities in industry. Medical investigations and epidemiological studies proved the correlation between such activities and the occurrence of lumbago, low back pain and adverse effects on the shoulders. The ISO 11228â??2:2007 provides the recommended limits for pushing and pulling. Such values are the results of psychophysical studies realized under prescribed speed conditions referring to a slow walk. However, observation of real industrial and service sector environments reveals that workers are required to perform pushing activities at higher speed of motion. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the variation in the speed of motion and load conditions on push forces. 96 subjects performed a total of 2592 trials consisting of pushing an industrial trolley for warehouse applications, at different speed values and load conditions. Results confirm the presence of correlation between the increasing speed of motion and push forces. The findings have practical value for researchers, occupational physicians and ergonomics practitioners.","Push force, Initial force, Sustained force, Speed of motion, Industrial trolley",Lucia Botti and Francesco Gabriele Galizia and Cristina Mora and Giorgio Zecchi,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300284,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103080,0003-6870,2020,103080,85,Applied Ergonomics,A thorough investigation on pushing activities in industry: The impact of the variation in the speed of motion and load conditions on initial and sustained forces,article,BOTTI2020103080
"Ergonomic risk factors, such as excessive physical effort, awkward postures or repetitive movements, were the leading causes of injuries amongst EMS workers in the United States, of which 90% were attributed to lifting, carrying, or transferring a patient and/or equipment. Although the essential tasks of patient handling, transport, and care cannot be eliminated, the design of ambulances and associated equipment is modifiable. Our aims were to identify the extent of Human Factors and Ergonomic (HFE) considerations in existing ambulance design standards/regulations, and describe how HFE and the standards/regulations were applied in the EMS system. Through an extensive environmental scan of jurisdictionally relevant standards/regulations and key informant interviews, our findings demonstrated that existing standards/regulations had limited considerations for HFE. As a result, HFE principles continue to be considered reactively through retrofit rather than proactively in upstream design. We recommend that performance-based HFE requirements be integrated directly into ambulance design standards.","Emergency medical services, Procurement, Management systems",Bronson Du and Michelle Boileau and Kayla Wierts and Stephanie Beatrix Karch and Marcus Yung and Steven Fischer and Amin Yazdani,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103144,0003-6870,2020,103144,88,Applied Ergonomics,Exploring the need for and application of human factors and ergonomics in ambulance design: Overcoming the barriers with technical standards,article,DU2020103144
"Soft exoskeletons apply compressive forces at the limbs via connection cuffs to actuate movement or stabilise joints. To avoid excessive mechanical loading, the interface with the wearer's body needs to be carefully designed. The purpose of this study was to establish the magnitude of circumferential compression at the lower limb during walking that causes discomfort/pain. It was hypothesized that the thresholds differ from those during standing. A cohort of 21 healthy participants were tested using two sizes of pneumatic cuffs, inflated at the thigh and calf in a tonic or phasic manner. The results showed lower inflation pressures triggering discomfort/pain at the thigh, with tonic compression, and wider pneumatic cuffs. The thresholds were lower during walking than standing still. Deep tissue oxygenation increased during phasic compression and decreased during tonic compression. According to the findings, circumferential compression by soft exoskeletons is preferably applied at anatomical sites with smaller volumes of soft tissue, using narrow connection cuffs and inflation pressures below 14Â kPa.","Soft exoskeleton-human interaction, Mechanical soft tissue loading, Walking",TjaÅ¡a Kermavnar and Kevin J.

"Research suggests an association between motor variability (MV) during repetitive work and work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). However, whether MV is a consistent individual trait, even across working conditions or tasks, remains unknown. This study assessed whether individual MV traits were consistent during complex work performed under different temporal conditions. Fifteen women performed cyclic assembly under four conditions differing in pace and organisation (line-type, batch-type). MV of trapezius muscle activity and upper arm elevation was quantified and partitioned into variance components. For all MV metrics, a non-zero between-subjects variance was found, indicating consistent individual MV traits across conditions. Variance between subjects was higher for electromyography (EMG) MV metrics compared with kinematic metrics. Our results showed individuals exhibited consistent MV traits across working conditions differing in pace and production process. Further research is needed to understand whether MV is an individual predictive factor for MSD onset or progression.","Motor control, Trapezius electromyography, Upper arm elevation angle",Jennie A.

"This laboratory study evaluated different assistive devices for reducing biomechanical loading during patient turning tasks. Twenty caregivers (18 females and 2 males) performed standardized patient turning tasks with two simulated patients (body mass: 74Â kg and 102Â kg). The turning tasks were performed in two turning directions (toward vs. away relative to caregivers) using five device conditions: draw sheet, friction-reducing turning sheet, air-assisted transfer device, air-assisted turning device, and no assistive device. Low back and upper extremity muscle activity, trunk and shoulder postures, low back moment, and self-reported usability ratings were evaluated. While all assistive devices reduced trunk flexion, both air-assisted transfer and turning devices reduced the trunk flexion (p'sÂ <Â 0.001) and muscle activity (p'sÂ <Â 0.001) in the erector spinae and triceps compared to no assistive device condition. These results suggest that the air-assisted devices have potential as an effective intervention to considerably reduce physical risk factors associated with caregivers' musculoskeletal disorders in low back and upper extremities.","Low back moment, Shoulder posture, Musculoskeletal disorders, Patient handling, Electromyography",Jaejin Hwang and Hemateja Ari and Megha Matoo and Jie Chen and Jeong Ho Kim,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702030079X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103121,0003-6870,2020,103121,87,Applied Ergonomics,Air-assisted devices reduce biomechanical loading in the low back and upper extremities during patient turning tasks,article,HWANG2020103121
"Resilience principles show promise for improving the quality of healthcare, but there is a need for further theoretical development to include all levels and scales of activity across the whole healthcare system. Many existing models based on engineering concepts do not adequately address the prominence of social, cultural and organisational factors in healthcare work. Promising theoretical developments include the four resilience potentials, the CARE model and the Moments of Resilience Model, but they are all under specified and in need of further elaboration. This paper presents the Integrated Resilience Attributes Framework in which these three theoretical perspectives are integrated to provide examples of anticipating, responding, monitoring and learning at different scales of time and space.

"This study investigated the effects of using a single-axis force gauge for push/pull force measurement on kinetic/kinematic measures associated with the exertion and assessed agreement between forces recorded from two technologies (single-axis gauge, three-dimensional hand transducer) and various test conditions via intraclass correlations. Independent measures included exertion type (push, pull, turn), test condition (natural/cart alone, using force gauge at fast/slow/self-selected paces), and cart weight (light, heavy). Dependent measures included mean angles of force application, peak forces recorded from both technologies, and cart velocity. Excellent agreement was observed between technologies (ICCÂ =Â 0.998). Likewise, peak forces using the single-axis gauge at the fast pace agreed best with the natural test condition (ICCÂ =Â 0.631). Forces should be measured using a faster initial acceleration and sustained velocity than is prescribed by the current standard if they are to accurately approximate forces relative to existing push/pull guidelines.

"Background Due to the demographic challenge in most countries it is important to consider making work life sustainable. A sustainable work life is of importance in all age groups when working life will be extended to a higher age. Aim Towards a theoretical model with an impact on a sustainable working life for all ages, the swAge - model. Method The theoretical model, the swAge-model, is developed based on grounded theory using qualitative studies, quantitative studies, intervention projects and literature reviews. Result The swAge-model states the interactions between different ageing concepts; chronological, mental, biological and social ageing, and the nine areas of importance for individualsâ?? work life participation. The model also states the four consideration areas whether individuals can and want to participate in an extended working life or not. The model also includes proposed measures at the organisation/enterprise level and at the society level based on the four activity areas at the individual level. Conclusion The theoretical swAge-model describes how to reflect on working life and presents tools to extend work life in a sustainable way for older workers in modern society. The swAge-modelsâ?? analysis and measure matrix is included as appendix 1. In the Nordic countries the theoretical model is use in the critical debate and as a tool for managers and authorities to make the working life sustainable for all ages.","Ageing, Older workers, Demography, Retirement, Prevention, Health, Work disease, Economic, Work environment, Working hours, Recreation, Age management, Skills and competence development, Motivation and work satisfaction, Family and leisure pursuits",Kerstin Nilsson,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018305313,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103082,0003-6870,2020,103082,86,Applied Ergonomics,A sustainable working life for all ages â??

"The purpose of this study was to compare caregiver muscle activation and joint angles between two ergonomic transport chairs designed to mitigate discomfort and safety risks associated with patient transport, the StrykerÂ® Prime TC and the StaxiÂ® Medical Chair, and a depot wheelchair. Twenty-three caregivers completed level walking and ramped tasks with each device and an 84Â kg manikin. Surface electromyography for the upper extremities and back muscles and motion data were collected. The Staxi showed a statistical trend for higher wrist extensor and flexor carpi ulnaris activity compared to the Stryker chair (pÂ â?¤Â 0.078) and greater wrist flexion than the Stryker and depot chairs (pÂ â?¤Â 0.004). The depot chair showed greater peak trunk flexion than the Stryker chair (pÂ =Â 0.004).

The auditory cues were either 1) informative on the timing and direction of the upcoming motion, or 2) non-informative. Illness ratings were recorded at 1-min intervals using a 11-point scale. After exposure, average illness ratings were significantly lower for the condition that contained informative auditory cues, as compared to the condition without informative cues. This knowledge, i.e. that auditory signals can improve anticipation to motion, could be of importance in reducing carsickness in domains such as that of autonomous vehicles.","Motion sickness, Autonomous driving, Multisensory integration, Anticipation, Carsickness, Countermeasures, Unpredictable motion",Ouren X.

"Worn shoes are known to contribute to slip-and-fall risk, a common cause of workplace injuries. However, guidelines for replacing shoes are not well developed. Recent experiments and lubrication theory suggest that the size of the worn region is an important contributor to the shoe tread's ability to drain fluid and therefore the under-shoe friction. This study evaluated a simple test for comparing the size of the worn region relative to a common object (AAA and AA battery) as a means of determining shoe replacement. This study consisted of three components involving slip-resistant shoes: Experiment #1: a longitudinal, mechanical, accelerated wear experiment; Experiment #2: a longitudinal experiment where the same shoes were tested after each month of worker use; and Experiment #3: a cross-sectional experiment that exposed participants to a slippery condition, while donning their own worn shoes. The COF (Experiments #1 and #2); under-shoe fluid pressure (all experiments); and slip severity (Experiment #3) were compared across outcomes (fail/pass) of the battery tests. Larger fluid pressures, lower coefficient of friction, and more severe slips were observed for shoes that failed the battery tests compared with those passing the tests. This method offers promise for assessing loss in friction and an increase in slip risk for slip-resistant shoes.","Slip, Trip, And fall accidents, Footwear, Observational tools, Personal protective equipment, Equipment inspection",Kurt E.

"Augmented reality (AR) systems are becoming common tools in industrial workplaces. However, factory workers are still concerned about whether head-mounted display (HMD)-based AR systems distract their awareness of the environment and therefore pose safety risks. The purpose of this study was to assess users' experience of real-world awareness when using an AR system. 19 study participants played a wooden block logic game in a laboratory with three different setups: real, AR and virtual reality (VR). Based on this study, it can be concluded that HMD-based AR systems do not decrease usersâ?? awareness of their surroundings if the virtual content is minimal and the task is done while seated. However, it was seen that more research in this area with more interactive virtual content is required. This study is an important step in understanding how AR may affect future work in industrial and safety-critical environments.","Augmented reality, Awareness, Workload",Susanna Aromaa and Antti VÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤nen and Iina Aaltonen and Vladimir Goriachev and Kaj Helin and Jaakko Karjalainen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103145,0003-6870,2020,103145,88,Applied Ergonomics,Awareness of the real-world environment when using augmented reality head-mounted display,article,AROMAA2020103145
"Using a simulated X-ray screening task, we tested 122 airport security screeners working with the support of explosives detection systems for cabin baggage screening (EDSCB) as low-level automation. EDSCB varied systematically on three automation reliability measures: accuracy, d', and positive predictive value (PPV). Results showed that when unaided performance was high, operator confidence was high, and automation provided only small benefits. When unaided performance was lower, operator confidence was lower, and automation with higher d' provided large benefits. Operator compliance depended on the PPV of automation: We found lower compliance for lower PPV. Automation with a high false alarm rate of 20% and a low PPV of .3 resulted in operators ignoring about one-half of the true automation alarms on difficult targetsâ??a strong cry-wolf effect. Our results suggest that automation reliability described by d' and PPV is more valid than using accuracy alone. When the PPV is below .5, operators should receive clear instructions on how to respond to automation alarms.","Humanâ??automation interaction, Airport security baggage screening, Visual search",David Huegli and Sarah Merks and Adrian Schwaninger,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300570,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103094,0003-6870,2020,103094,86,Applied Ergonomics,"Automation reliability, humanâ??machine system performance, and operator compliance: A study with airport security screeners supported by automated explosives detection systems for cabin baggage screening",article,HUEGLI2020103094
"Current industrial production systems allow assembly of customised products which include additional elements distinguishing them from a reference model. This customisation can result in significant additional time constraints which compel workers to complete their tasks faster, which may pose problems for older workers. The objective of this laboratory study was to investigate the impact of restrictive or flexible pacing during assembly of customised products among groups of younger and older participants. The data gathered were used to analyse cycle-time, assembly performance, muscular load, and kinematic adaptations. The flexible pacing condition was found to improve production performance, increasing customised assembly cycle-time and reducing biomechanical load, for both young and older participants. However, as the task required fine manual dexterity, older participants were subjected to a higher biomechanical load, even in the flexible pacing scenario. These results should encourage assembly-line designers to allow flexible time constraints as much as possible and to be particularly attentive to the needs of older workers.","Ageing, Repetitive assembly work, Musculoskeletal disorders",L.

"We present the design and test of a wearable device capable to detect the user's trunk orientation with respect to the gravitational field and to provide tactile stimulation to correct tilted positions. Vibrations are delivered to the shoulders, the frontal and dorsal parts of the trunk, by using the human body as an indicator of the four cardinal directions. The device was experimentally tested in normal gravity conditions by thirty-nine volunteers. The efficacy of tactile cues was investigated in comparison to visual and visuo-tactile cues. The results revealed that, despite the fact that the time needed to complete the task was shorter when people were guided by visual signals, the tactile cues were equally informative and, in some cases, the trunk spatial orientation was even more accurate. Overall, tactile cues were evaluated by users as more intuitive, effective and accurate.","Haptics, Trunk orientation, Wearable device",Roberta Etzi and Alberto Gallace and Gemma Massetti and Marco D'Agostino and Viola Cinquetti and Francesco Ferrise and Monica Bordegoni,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301307,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103176,0003-6870,2020,103176,88,Applied Ergonomics,Conveying trunk orientation information through a wearable tactile interface,article,ETZI2020103176
"The aim of this study was to employ validated biological markers to quantify the physiologic consequences of exposure to whole-body vibration (WBV) and evaluate the relative impact of mining vehicle operator vibration exposure on physiological responses as compared to vertical-axial dominant WBV. In a laboratory-based study with a repeated-measures design, we played actual field-measured floor vibration profiles into a 6-degree-of-freedom motion platform to create different realistic WBV exposures: 1) vertical-dominant vibration collected from long-haul trucks, 2) multi-axial vibration collected from mining heavy equipment vehicles, and 3) no vibration (control condition). Circulating biomarkers of interest were cortisol and catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) to assess physiological stress, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNFÎ±) to test for inflammation, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) to measure oxidative stress, and myoglobin and plasma creatine kinase to assess muscle damage. We collected blood samples at pre-exposure (0Â h), during-exposure (2 and 4Â h), and 2Â h into recovery after the WBV exposure (6Â h) in all four exposure conditions. The results showed that a single, 4-h acute exposure to WBV may not be sufficient to induce skeletal muscle damage, inflammation or physiologic stress measurable in the blood. No significant differences were observed between conditions for any of the biomarkers that could be attributed to the exposure contrast between vertical-dominant and multi-axial WBV exposures. These findings further indicate known complications of WBV exposure likely arise secondary to chronic, repeated exposures that give rise to subclinical stresses that were not captured here.","Biomarkers, Off-road vehicles, Muscle damage, Oxidative stress, Musculoskeletal disorders, Professional drivers",Kiana Kia and Stephanie M.

"This study evaluated the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions in material handling operations involving 33 employers and 535 employees from 2012 to 2017. Outcomes included employee-reported low back/upper extremity pain and safety incidents at baseline, every three months, and annually for up to two years. A total of 32.5% of employees completed at least one survey, while 13.6% completed all nine surveys over two years. Among highly exposed employees (who reported handling >= 50 lbs.Â >Â 33% of the time), upper extremity pain frequency and severity were lower among those who reported using the intervention routinely versus those that reported using their body strength alone to handle objects >= 50 lbs. After excluding from analyses one employer that used anti-fatigue mats, low back pain frequency was also significantly lower among highly exposed intervention users.

"A field intervention study was implemented to evaluate the effects of individual (physical exercise programme and worker ergonomics training) and organisational changes (optimising workâ??rest schedule and revised task procedure) on musculoskeletal outcomes and their exposure risks among milking workers in a dairy plant. A questionnaire survey (including the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire [CMDQ]) and direct observations of working postures by using the Quick Exposure Check (QEC) method were used at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Shoulder, lower back and neck discomfort were found to be the most common problems. The results showed significant improvements in the frequency (neck, shoulder, lower back, forearm and knee symptoms), severity (shoulder, lower back and knee symptoms) and interference with work (particularly due to lower back symptoms) as well as in the exposure risks to musculoskeletal problems (using the QEC method) after the intervention.

"Using a work domain analysis and complementary thematic analysis, this paper aims to describe medication management work, its constraints, and complexities from the perspectives of family caregivers of children with medical complexityâ??a medically fragile segment of the pediatric population often dependent on multiple and complex medication regimens for survival and optimal functioning. Analyses were informed by data generated through observations of 12 care coordination clinic visits within a pediatric complex care program, semi-structured interviews of 11 family caregivers, and reviews of program documents. Our results show that family caregivers: (1) formulate medication management goals, identify values and criteria to judge goals but these may not necessarily be acknowledged and explicitly supported by system resources and healthcare professionals (2) are engaged in a range of complex medication management tasks that are both physically and emotionally demanding without the support of well-designed tools and resources to enhance their work.","Children with medical complexity, Disabled children, Ergonomics, Medication therapy Management",Ephrem Abebe and Matthew C.

"Resilient healthcare emphasises the importance of adaptive capacity in quality healthcare. This theory has had extensive theoretical development, but comparatively limited translation for clinicians in practice. This study is the first to present resilient healthcare principles in a serious video game. Serious games are an effective tool for engaging users, sharing ideas and eliciting reflections. The aim of this study was to communicate principles from resilient healthcare to clinicians through a serious video game, and to evaluate the game's feasibility as a prompt to reflect on practice. The game, Resilience Challenge, is scenario-based and requires players to resolve dilemmas in clinical practice. It was disseminated online, and was played 1949 times during the four-month study. The game was evaluated using an immediate cross-sectional survey, which included both Likert-style and free text responses. Participants reported that the game was engaging (93%) and that they would recommend it to others (89%). Fewer participants reported learning about resilient healthcare concepts (64%). Resilience Challenge is a promising way to prompt reflections about clinical work, and demonstrates mixed outcomes in communicating resilient healthcare principles to clinicians.","Resilience, Safety II, Serious video game, Healthcare, Resilience engineering, Gamification, Resilient healthcare, Serious games, Feasibility, Reflection, Survey",Jennifer Jackson and Jo Iacovides and Myanna Duncan and Matthew Alders and Jill Maben and Janet Anderson,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300739,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103112,0003-6870,2020,103112,87,Applied Ergonomics,Operationalizing resilient healthcare concepts through a serious video game for clinicians,article,JACKSON2020103112
"This study examines the effects of ground surface, load, one- and two-wheeled wheelbarrow on muscular activities, hand force, and subject-perceived exertions while pushing a wheelbarrow in a straight line on a horizontal surface. The experimental results show that wheelbarrow load significantly affected muscular activities, hand force, and subject-perceived exertion. Additionally, different ground surfaces and wheelbarrow types also affected the muscular activities of the dominant hand; grass generated the highest muscle load and asphalt pavement generated the smallest muscle load. The user has to apply 57% and 23% more force in the vertical and horizontal direction while pushing one-vs. two-wheeled wheelbarrow. Muscular activity increased significantly in the dominant hand with the one-wheeled wheelbarrow compared with the two-wheeled wheelbarrow, suggesting that, in terms of muscle loads, the two-wheeled wheelbarrow is better than the one-wheeled wheelbarrow.","Pushing task, Wheelbarrow, Muscular activity, EMG",Yen-Hui Lin and Shih-Yi Lu,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702030106X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103151,0003-6870,2020,103151,88,Applied Ergonomics,"Effects of ground and load on upper trapezius, biceps brachii muscle and hand forces in one- and two-wheeled wheelbarrow pushing",article,LIN2020103151
"The purpose of this study was to assess postural stability in the medial-lateral (ML) direction when carrying unilateral and bilateral loads during stair negotiation. Twenty-four healthy young adults were instructed to ascend and descend a three step staircase under three load conditions: no load, 20% body mass (BM) bilateral load, and 20% BM unilateral load. A modified time-to-contact (TTC) method was proposed to evaluate postural stability during stair negotiation. Carrying unilateral loads required more rapid postural adjustments as evidenced by lower minimum ML TTC and ML TTC percentage as compared bilateral loads and no load during stair descent. In addition, lower ML TTC and TTC percentage were found for loaded limb stance for stair descent. Taken together, unilateral loads and the loaded leg during stair descent are of concern when considering postural stability during load carriage.

"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the combined effects of noise and air temperature on the human body neurophysiological responses. This study was conducted on 35 male students, who were exposed to four different air temperatures (18Â Â°C, 22Â Â°C, 26Â Â°C, and 30Â Â°C) and two noise levels (55 dBA and 75 dBA) in eight sessions in a simulated indoor environment. The mean values of accuracy and time of response to stimuli in N-back test as well as neurophysiological responses were measured. In the studied experiment configurations, with increasing air temperature and noise, the working memory and neurophysiological responses were disturbed. The results indicated the significant effect of noise on working memory, as compared with that of air temperature. The effects of air temperature on heart rate, respiratory rate as well as theta and alpha bands were more significant than the impact of noise. The combined effects of noise and air temperature were more significant than the influence of each of them alone. In the presence of high noise levels, the increase in air temperature did not worsen the response accuracy. However, in the presence of high noise level, the rise in air temperature aggravated the mean value of neurophysiological responses. Overall, noise has a greater effect on working memory, while the air temperature can disturb neurophysiological responses in a more profound way.","Indoor environment, Neurophysiological responses, Combined effects, Noise, Air temperature",Ali Mohammad Abbasi and Majid Motamedzade and Mohsen Aliabadi and Rostam Golmohammadi and Leili Tapak,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687018303703,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103189,0003-6870,2020,103189,88,Applied Ergonomics,Combined effects of noise and air temperature on human neurophysiological responses in a simulated indoor environment,article,ABBASI2020103189
"Several tools have been developed over the past twenty years to assess the degree of driver distraction caused by secondary task engagement. A relatively new and promising method in this area is the box task combined with a detection response task (BTÂ +Â DRT). However, no evaluation regarding the BT's sensitivity currently exists. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the BTÂ +Â DRT by comparing its sensitivity to the sensitivity of already established methods. Twenty-nine participants engaged in several artificial and realistic secondary tasks while either performing the BTÂ +Â DRT, the Lane Change Test (LCT), or driving through a simple course in a simulator. The results showed that the BT parameters (especially the standard deviation of box position and size) were sensitive to differences in demand across the visual-manual secondary tasks. This was comparable to what was found with the LCT. Surprisingly, the BT performance measures were more sensitive than those of the driving simulation task. The BTÂ +Â DRT also captured cognitive distraction effects with the integration of the DRT. Hence, the BTÂ +Â DRT could be a cost-effective method to assess in-vehicle system demand. However, further investigations are necessary to better understand the potential of the BT method.","Driver distraction, In-vehicle information systems, Evaluation methods",Tina Morgenstern and Elisabeth M.

"Two passive back-support exoskeleton (BSE) designs were assessed in terms of muscular activity, energy expenditure, joint kinematics, and subjective responses. Eighteen participants (gender-balanced) completed repetitive lifting tasks in nine different conditions, involving symmetric and asymmetric postures and using two BSEs (along with no BSE as a control condition). Wearing both BSEs significantly reduced peak levels of trunk extensor muscle activity (by ~9â??20%) and reduced energy expenditure (by ~8â??14%). Such reductions, though, were more pronounced in the symmetric conditions and differed between the two BSEs tested. Participants reported lower perceived exertion using either BSE yet raised concerns regarding localized discomfort. Minimal changes in lifting behaviors were evident when using either BSE, and use of both BSEs led to generally positive usability ratings. While these results are promising regarding the occupational use of BSEs, future work is recommended to consider inter-individual differences to accommodate diverse user needs and preferences.","Lifting, Low-back pain, Energy expenditure, Electromyography, Usability",Saman Madinei and Mohammad Mehdi Alemi and Sunwook Kim and Divya Srinivasan and Maury A.

"The PC-based driver training programme, Risk Awareness and Perception Training (RAPT) has been successful in improving young drivers' hazard anticipation and mitigation responses in both simulator and on-road studies. The current research aimed to evaluate the success of an adaptation of this training for the UK context, along with investigating the impact of the presentation modality on RAPT effectiveness. Traditionally RAPT has been delivered on a PC monitor, which does not allow the same range of head and eye movements that drivers use when on the road. Thus, it was anticipated that the 360Â° field-of-view provided by Head Mounted Display (HMD) technology would provide a more ecologically valid experience, facilitating deeper processing and encoding of driving relevant scanning patterns, and an increased capacity to identify potentially hazardous areas of a driving scenario. Using a between-subjects design, three different training modalities were compared - a PC-based version using still images (PC-Stills), a HMD version using still images (HMD-Stills), and a HMD version using videos (HMD-video). All three training groupsâ?? performance on the UK Hazard Perception test was compared to that of a control group, who received no training. Results indicated that the adaptation of the training materials for the UK context was successful, with all three training programmes leading to performance improvements in the RAPT tests. Although participants in the HMD-video condition required more attempts to pass the training, this group showed the greatest improvement in hazard perception scores from the pre- to the post-training tests. Results also showed scenario-based differences between the modalities, suggesting that the success of different versions of RAPT may be linked to the type of risky scenario being targeted.","Hazard anticipation, Risk awareness, Driver training, Head mounted display",Ruth Madigan and Richard Romano,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300260,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103076,0003-6870,2020,103076,85,Applied Ergonomics,Does the use of a head mounted display increase the success of risk awareness and perception training (RAPT) for drivers?,article,MADIGAN2020103076
"Objectives Investigate whether a range of cooling methods can extend tolerance time and/or reduce physiological strain in those working in the heat dressed in a Class 2 chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) protective ensemble. Methods Eight males wore a Class 2 CBRN ensemble and walked for a maximum of 120Â min at 35Â Â°C, 50% relative humidity. In a randomised order, participants completed the trial with no cooling and four cooling protocols: 1) ice-based cooling vest (IV), 2) a non-ice-based cooling vest (PCM), 3) ice slushy consumed before work, combined with IV (SLIV) and 4) a portable battery-operated water-perfused suit (WPS). Mean with 95% confidence intervals are presented. Results Tolerance time was extended in PCM (46 [36, 56] min, PÂ =Â 0.018), SLIV (56 [46, 67] min, PÂ <Â 0.001) and WPS (62 [53, 70] min, PÂ <Â 0.001), compared with control (39 [30, 48] min). Tolerance time was longer in SLIV and WPS compared with both IV (48 [39, 58Â min]) and PCM (PÂ â?¤Â 0.011). After 20Â min of work, HR was lower in SLIV (121 [105, 136] beatsÂ·minâ??1), WPS (117 [101, 133] beatsÂ·minâ??1) and IV (130 [116, 143] beatsÂ·minâ??1) compared with control (137 [120, 155] beatsÂ·minâ??1) (all PÂ <Â 0.001). PCM (133 [116, 151] beatsÂ·minâ??1) did not differ from control. Conclusion All cooling methods, except PCM, utilised in the present study reduced cardiovascular strain, while SLIV and WPS are most likely to extend tolerance time for those working in the heat dressed in a Class 2 CBRN ensemble.","Heat stress, Cardiovascular strain, Thermal strain, Thermoregulation, Body cooling, Occupational",Matthew J.

"Heat generated in electronic devices is generally unevenly distributed across the casing. Contacting the hot areas may cause thermal discomfort and possibly skin burn. This study aims at better understanding the interrelationship between the thermal sensation, material properties and surface temperature for enhancing the user experience of electronic devices. A Thermal Simulation System was developed in this study to precisely control the surface temperature of shell materials to simulate various end-use conditions. Seventeen participants were asked to contact the plates with their fingers and rate their thermal sensation using the magnitude estimation approach. Results showed that thermal sensation magnitude and plate temperature followed a power function. The differences in sensation magnitude can be attributed to the thermal inertias of different materials. The findings suggested that laminated plate was generally perceived cooler when heated. Given that the surface temperature of plate is higher than skin, the thermal sensation magnitude increases with contact duration.","Thermal sensation, Material selection, Subjective assessment",Ka-Po Maggie Tang and Yuen-Shing Wu and Jin-tu Fan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702030065X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103104,0003-6870,2020,103104,86,Applied Ergonomics,"Effect of material property, surface temperature and contact duration on the thermal sensation when contacting shell materials of electronic devices",article,TANG2020103104
"Health information technology (IT) implementation has encompassed much of the United States health care system over the past decade, and user frustration with health IT has steadily increased. Human factors and ergonomics (HFE) methods and approaches can improve the design, implementation, and use of health IT for clinicians and consumers. To better understand the effect of federal HFE in health IT research funding, the authors conducted a review of several key, specific initiatives. The review focused on the goals and accomplishments of these initiatives. Findings to date show that HFE is improving the usefulness of health IT, but additional research and new methods are needed. Corresponding research funding and policy priorities are identified. New HFE work and innovative approaches are needed to capitalize on HFE knowledge, principles, and methods to improve the design, implementation, and use of health IT at a broader scale.","Human factors and ergonomics, Health care, Health information technology",Teresa Zayas-CabÃ¡n and P.

"This paper compares clinician hand motion for common suturing tasks across a range of experience levels and tissue types. Medical students (32), residents (41), attending surgeons (10), and retirees (2) were recorded on digital video while suturing on one of: foam, pig feet, or porcine bowel. Depending on time in position, each medical student, resident, and attending participant was classified as junior or senior, yielding six experience categories. This work focuses on trends associated with increasing tenure observed from those medical students (10), residents (15), and attendings (10) who sutured on foam, and draws comparison across tissue types where pertinent. Utilizing custom software, the two-dimensional location of each of the participant's hands were automatically recorded in every video frame, producing a rich spatiotemporal feature set. While suturing on foam, increasing clinician experience was associated with conserved path length per cycle of the non-dominant hand, significantly reducing from junior medical students (meanÂ =Â 73.63Â cm, sdÂ =Â 33.21Â cm) to senior residents (meanÂ =Â 46.16Â cm, sdÂ =Â 14.03Â cm, pÂ =Â 0.015), and again between senior residents and senior attendings (meanÂ =Â 30.84Â cm, sdÂ =Â 14.51Â cm, pÂ =Â 0.045). Despite similar maneuver rates, attendings also accelerated less with their non-dominant hand (meanÂ =Â 16.27Â cm/s2, sdÂ =Â 81.12Â cm/s2, pÂ =Â 0.002) than senior residents (meanÂ =Â 24.84Â cm/s2, sdÂ =Â 68.29Â cm/s2, pÂ =Â 0.002). While tying, medical students moved their dominant hands slower (meanÂ =Â 4.39Â cm/s, sdÂ =Â 1.73Â cm/s, p = 0.033) than senior residents (meanÂ =Â 6.53Â cm/s, sdÂ =Â 2.52Â cm/s). These results suggest that increased psychomotor performance during early training manifest through faster dominant hand function, while later increases are characterized by conserving energy and efficiently distributing work between hands. Incorporating this scalable video-based motion analysis into regular formative assessment routines may enable greater quality and consistency of feedback throughout a surgical career.","Marker-less, Assessment, Surgery",David P.

"Background Masons have a high rate of musculoskeletal disorders among construction workers and greater than all other industries. Viable solutions to musculoskeletal hazards have been identified by industry stakeholders, yet masons receive minimal ergonomics training. Apprentices, as the next generation of masons, need training and strategies to identify and speak up about ergonomic and safety issues on job sites. To fill this gap, our team developed the Safety Voice for Ergonomics (SAVE) training program. Methods The interactive, 7-unit SAVE program was developed specifically for masonry brick and block apprentices. This innovative training contains detailed ergonomics lessons focusing on risk factors and solutions specific to this masonry craft. It also contains lessons that provide communication and problem solving strategies. Evaluation of SAVE employed a randomized control trial designed to assess the effectiveness of SAVE for apprentices over a six-month period. Results Our findings demonstrated that compared to controls, SAVE trained apprentices used their safety voice more (PÂ =Â .049) and had greater safety participation (PÂ =Â .028). They adopted more ergonomic practices such as adjusting scaffolding (PÂ =Â .016) and using better body postures (PÂ =Â 042). Apprentices liked SAVE and indicated that it prompted them to change workplace safety behaviors. Conclusions SAVE is an effective program, providing needed ergonomic and safety communication training for workers as they begin their trade. The broad adoption of SAVE training by the masonry industry has the potential to empower apprentices, elevate the trade's safety culture, and ultimately reduce musculoskeletal disorders.","Construction, Soft tissue injuries, Safety communication, Health & safety",Jennifer A.

"The purpose of this study was to develop a new pipette design in which the pipette is operated by four fingers, taking into account the anatomy and anthropometry of the hand. The proposed new pipette designs were compared with a traditional thumb-push pipette based on muscle activity, wrist posture, subjective discomfort ratings for upper extremities, and user preference. The results of the study revealed that the four-finger, ergonomic pipette design reduced muscle exertion (25% reduction for aspiration and 35% reduction for dispensing), awkward wrist posture (33% reduction in wrist flexion, radial and ulnar deviation), and perceived discomfort in the wrist, hand and lower arm. Furthermore, most participants (9 of 10) who used a pipette in their daily work preferred the new pipette designs to a traditional thumb-push pipette design. Thus, we expect that this study will contribute to the reduction of WMSDs risk factors and pain.","Pipette design, Musculoskeletal injuries, Four-finger-push pipette, EMG, Wrist posture, Borg CR-10 scale",Eunsik Kim and Faisal Aqlan and Andris Freivalds,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103045,0003-6870,2020,103045,85,Applied Ergonomics,Development of an ergonomic four-finger-push manual pipette design,article,KIM2020103045
"Over the years, the industryâ??s interest in using external support devices, such as exoskeletons, is increasing. They are introduced as a new technique for improving the conditions of workers and for reducing the risk of musculoskeletal injuries. An investigation of muscle activity, Jonssonâ??s (Jonsson, 1982) ergonomic acceptance ranges, and shoulder range of motion was conducted with a sample of 12 workers using an upper extremity exoskeleton in an automotive assembly line. The operators performed continuous cycles of dynamic overhead work consisting of the assembly of the car body at the underside of the car making use of pneumatic screwdrivers. The EMGs (anterior part of deltoid, trapezius, latissimus dorsi and erector spinae) were measured for the muscle activity analysis on the one hand, and for the ergonomics study on the other hand. The latter consisted of an approach based on Jonssonâ??s work, that establishes acceptance thresholds of cumulative percentage of maximum voluntary contraction of muscle activity (%MVC) in a work cycle. The joint angles motion capture was carried out by measuring the angles of the neck, back, and arms joints. All measurements were performed during experimental sessions with and without an exoskeleton. The key findings show reductions of 34% and 18% of the deltoid and the trapezius muscular activities, respectively, which in turn could lead to a reduction of discomfort and fatigue. The erector spinae and latissimus dorsi muscles were not significantly affected by exoskeleton. The values of muscular activity were also represented over Jonssonâ??s acceptance areas. Referring to the posture, some differences were found in the range of movement of back, neck, and arms owing to the use of the exoskeleton; however, the differences were smaller than 5% in all cases.","Exoskeleton, Upper-limb, EMG, Motion-tracking, Industry conditions, Automotive",SofÃ­a Iranzo and Alicia Piedrabuena and Daniel Iordanov and Ursula Martinez-Iranzo and Juan-Manuel Belda-Lois,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300788,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103120,0003-6870,2020,103120,87,Applied Ergonomics,Ergonomics assessment of passive upper-limb exoskeletons in an automotive assembly plant,article,IRANZO2020103120
"Driver sleepiness contributes to traffic accidents. However, sleepiness in urban public transport remains an understudied subject. To fill this gap, we examined the sleepiness, sleep, and on-duty sleepiness countermeasures (SCMs) in 23 tram drivers working morning, day, and evening shifts for three weeks. Sleepiness was measured using Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Nocturnal total sleep time (TST) was measured with wrist actigraphy. SCMs and naps were self-reported with a smartphone application. Caffeine and napping were considered effective SCMs. Severe sleepiness (KSSÂ â?¥Â 7) was observed in 22% of shifts with no differences between shift types. Rest breaks were associated with slight reductions in sleepiness. TST between days off averaged 7Â h but was 1Â h 33Â min and 38Â min shorter prior to morning and day shifts, respectively. The use of effective SCMs showed little variance between shift types. These results highlight the need for fatigue management in non-night-working tram drivers.","Sleep loss, Urban transportation, Driver fatigue",Jussi Onninen and Tarja Hakola and Sampsa Puttonen and Asko Tolvanen and Jussi Virkkala and Mikael Sallinen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301083,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103153,0003-6870,2020,103153,88,Applied Ergonomics,Sleep and sleepiness in shift-working tram drivers,article,ONNINEN2020103153
"Introduction Primary care is complex due to multiple health problems being addressed in each patient visit. Little is known about the effect of the number of problems per encounter (NPPE) on the resulting clinician workload (CWL), as measured using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). Methods We evaluated the relationship between NPPE and CWL across 608 adult patient visits, conducted by 31 clinicians, using hierarchical linear regression. Clinicians were interviewed about outlier visits to identify reasons for higher or lower than expected CWL. Results Mean NPPE was 3.30Â Â±Â 2.0 (sd) and CWL was 47.6Â Â±Â 18.4 from a maximum of 100. Mental demand, time demand and effort accounted for 71.5% of CWL. After adjustment for confounders, each additional problem increased CWL by 3.9 points (PÂ <Â 0.001). Patient, problem, environmental and patient-physician relationship factors were qualitatively identified from interviews as moderators of this effect. Conclusion CWL is positively related to NPPE. Several modifiable factors may enhance or mitigate this effect. Our findings have implications for using a Human Factors (HF) approach to managing CWL.",,Jonathan L. Temte and John W.

"Women experience higher prevalence of work-related upper limb musculoskeletal disorders compared to men. Previous studies have investigated the biological, kinematic and electromyographic sex-related differences during a lifting task but the actual differences in musculoskeletal loads remain unknown. We investigated the sex differences in three musculoskeletal indicators: the sum of muscle activations, the sum of muscle forces and the relative time spent beyond a shear-compression dislocation ratio. A musculoskeletal model was scaled on 20 women and 20 men lifting a 6 or 12kg box from hip to eye level. Women generated more muscle forces and activations than men, regardless of the lifted mass. Those differences occurred when the box was above shoulder level. In addition, women might spend more time beyond a shear-compression dislocation ratio. Our work suggests higher musculoskeletal loads among women compared to men during a lifting task, which could be the result of poor technique and strength difference.","Sex differences, Upper limb, Musculoskeletal modelling",Romain Martinez and Najoua Assila and Etienne Goubault and MickaÃ«l Begon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300673,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103106,0003-6870,2020,103106,86,Applied Ergonomics,Sex differences in upper limb musculoskeletal biomechanics during a lifting task,article,MARTINEZ2020103106
"Hospital-based care of pediatric trauma patients includes transitions between units that are critical for quality of care and patient safety. Using a macroergonomics approach, we identify work system barriers and facilitators in care transitions. We interviewed eighteen healthcare professionals involved in transitions from emergency department (ED) to operating room (OR), OR to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and ED to PICU. We applied the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) process modeling method and identified nine dimensions of barriers and facilitators â?? anticipation, ED decision making, interacting with family, physical environment, role ambiguity, staffing/resources, team cognition, technology and characteristic of trauma care. For example, handoffs involving all healthcare professionals in the OR to PICU transition created a shared understanding of the patient, but sometimes included distractions. Understanding barriers and facilitators can guide future improvements, e.g., designing a team display to support team cognition of healthcare professionals in the care transitions.","Macroergonomics, Pediatric trauma care transitions, SEIPS",Abigail R.

"Primary health care is a complex, highly personal, and non-linear process. Care is often sub-optimal and professional burnout is high. Interventions intended to improve the situation have largely failed. This is due to a lack of a deep understanding of primary health care. Human Factors approaches and methods will aid in understanding the cognitive, social and technical needs of these specialties, and in designing and testing proposed innovations. In 2012, Ben-Tzion Karsh, Ph.D., conceived a transdisciplinary conference to frame the opportunities for research human factors and industrial engineering in primary care. In 2013, this conference brought together experts in primary care and human factors to outline areas where human factors methods can be applied. The results of this expert consensus panel highlighted four major research areas: Cognitive and social needs, patient engagement, care of community, and integration of care. Work in these areas can inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of innovations in Primary Care.

"Trunk muscles play an important role during load lifting and contract to control trunk stability. The aim of present study was to investigate immediate effects of using various insole wedges on activation and co-contraction indices of selected trunk muscles during load lifting. Thirty able-bodied males completed load lifting task using nine various insole wedges. The results showed these significant differences: for normalized mean amplitude of RA muscle between posterior and anterior-medial wedges and for QL muscle between posterior and lateral wedges, for normalized peak amplitude of RA muscle between posterior and anterior-medial wedges, for median frequency of LES muscle between anterior-medial and anterior-lateral wedges, and for co-contraction of RA/TES, RA/LES and RA/MU between posterior and anterior-medial wedges (PÂ =Â 0.001). These findings should be considered during designation of shoe or insole for work environments.

"The common cause hypothesis, as applied here, proposes that similar networks of influencing factors may contribute to both adverse outcomes and near misses. This hypothesis has not been evaluated using a systems-thinking perspective. The aims of this study are to evaluate whether networks of contributory and protective factors exist within aviation serious near miss reports and to determine if the common cause hypothesis is applicable in this context. Sixteen incident reports from French civil aviation crash investigation bureau were analysed using the AcciMap method. Contributory and protective factors, and relationships between both were identified via coding of the reports. The results indicate that considering protective factors support a richer picture of incidents and provide support for the common cause hypothesis as measured by similar mean factor volume and sociotechnical levels for both contributory and protective factors. However, the findings also show the direction of relationships among protective and contributory factors may be indicative of a difference among adverse outcomes, near misses, and normal work. Future research should consider how a network of relationships may impact on the common contributory and protective factors found in near misses.","Near miss, AcciMap analysis, Aviation, Common cause hypothesis",Brian Thoroman and Paul Salmon and Natassia Goode,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020300715,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103110,0003-6870,2020,103110,87,Applied Ergonomics,Applying AcciMap to test the common cause hypothesis using aviation near misses,article,THOROMAN2020103110
"Real-time risk assessment for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) has been a challenging research problem. Previous methods such as using depth cameras suffered from limited visual range and wearable sensors could cause intrusiveness to the workers, both of which are less feasible for long-run on-site applications. This document examines a novel end-to-end implementation of a deep learning-based algorithm for rapid upper limb assessment (RULA). The algorithm takes normal RGB images as input and outputs the RULA action level, which is a further division of RULA grand score. Lifting postures collected in laboratory and posture data from Human 3.6 (a public human pose dataset) were used for training and evaluating the algorithm. Overall, the algorithm achieved 93% accuracy and 29 frames per second efficiency for detecting the RULA action level. The results also indicate that using data augmentation (a strategy to diversify the training data) can significantly improve the robustness of the model. The proposed method demonstrates its high potential for real-time on-site risk assessment for the prevention of work-related MSD.

"This study aimed to characterize the biomechanical stresses in the neck and shoulder, self-reported discomfort, and usability by different target distance or size during augmented reality (AR) interactions. In a repeated-measures laboratory-based study, 20 participants (10 males) performed three standardized AR tasks (3-dimensional (3-D) cube, omni-directional pointing, and web-browsing tasks) with three target distances (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9Â m from each participant denoted by near, middle, far targets) for the 3-D cube and omni-directional pointing tasks or three target sizes: small (30% smaller than default), medium (default: 1.0Â Ã?Â 1.1Â m), and large (30% larger than default) for the web-browsing task. Joint angle, joint moment, muscle activity, self-reported discomfort and comfort in the neck and shoulders; and subjective usability ratings were measured. The results showed that shoulder angle (flexion and abduction), shoulder moment (flexion), middle deltoid muscle activity significantly increased as the target distance increased during the 3-D cube task (p'sÂ <Â 0.001). Self-reported neck and shoulder discomfort significantly increased after completing each task (p'sÂ <Â 0.001). The participants preferred the near to middle distance (0.3â??0.6Â m) or the medium to large window size due to task easiness (p'sÂ <Â 0.005). The highest task performance (speed) was occurred at the near distance or the large window size during the 3-D cube and web-browsing tasks (p'sÂ <Â 0.001). The results indicate that AR interactions with the far target distance (close to maximum reach envelop) may increase the risk for musculoskeletal discomfort in the shoulder regions. Given the increased usability and task performance, the near to middle distance (less than 0.6Â m) or the medium to large window size (greater than 1.0Â Ã?Â 1.1Â m) would be recommended for AR interactions.","Electromyography, Joint moment, Joint angle, Computer-related musculoskeletal disorders, Usability, Augmented reality",Jeong Ho Kim and Hemateja Ari and Charan Madasu and Jaejin Hwang,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687020301290,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103175,0003-6870,2020,103175,88,Applied Ergonomics,Evaluation of the biomechanical stress in the neck and shoulders during augmented reality interactions,article,KIM2020103175
"Decision support systems (DSSs) are being woven into human workflows from aviation to medicine. In this study, we examine decision quality and visual information foraging for DSSs with different known reliability levels. Thirty-six participants completed a financial fraud detection task, first unsupported and then supported by a DSS which highlighted important information sources. Participants were randomly allocated to four cohorts, being informed that the system's reliability was 100%, 90%, 80% or undisclosed. Results showed that only a DSS known to be 100% reliable resulted in participants systematically following its suggestions, increasing the percentage of correct classifications to a median of 100% while halving both, decision time and number of visually attended information sources. In all other conditions, the DSS had no effect on most visual sampling metrics, while decision quality of the human-DSS team was below the reliability level of the DSS.

"Industry 4.0 is the concept used to summarize the ongoing fourth industrial revolution, which is profoundly changing the manufacturing systems and business models all over the world. Collaborative robotics is one of the most promising technologies of Industry 4.0. Human-robot interaction and human-robot collaboration will be crucial for enhancing the operator's work conditions and production performance. In this regard, this enabling technology opens new possibilities but also new challenges. There is no doubt that safety is of primary importance when humans and robots interact in industrial settings. Nevertheless, human factors and cognitive ergonomics (i.e. cognitive workload, usability, trust, acceptance, stress, frustration, perceived enjoyment) are crucial, even if they are often underestimated or ignored. Therefore, this work refers to cognitive ergonomics in the design of human-robot collaborative assembly systems. A set of design guidelines has been developed according to the analysis of the scientific literature. Their effectiveness has been evaluated through multiple experiments based on a laboratory case study where different participants interacted with a low-payload collaborative robotic system for the joint assembly of a manufacturing product. The main assumption to be tested is that it is possible to improve the operator's experience and efficiency by manipulating the system features and interaction patterns according to the proposed design guidelines. Results confirmed that participants improved their cognitive response to human-robot interaction as well as the assembly performance with the enhancement of workstation features and interaction conditions by implementing an increasing number of guidelines.","Collaborative robotics, Collaborative assembly systems, Cognitive ergonomics, Human factors, Industry 4.0",Luca Gualtieri and Federico Fraboni and Matteo {De Marchi} and Erwin Rauch,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001302,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103807,0003-6870,2022,103807,104,Applied Ergonomics,Development and evaluation of design guidelines for cognitive ergonomics in human-robot collaborative assembly systems,article,GUALTIERI2022103807
"With the introduction of Level 3 and 4 automated driving, the engagement in a variety of non-driving related activities (NDRAs) will become legal. Previous research has shown that users desire information about the remaining time in automated driving mode and system status information to plan and terminate their activity engagement. In past studies, however, the positive effect of this additional information was realized when it was integrated in or displayed close by the NDRA. As future activities and corresponding items will be diverse, a device-independent and non-interruptive way of communication is required to continuously keep the user informed, thus avoiding negative effects on driver comfort and safety. With a set of two driving simulator studies, we have investigated the effectiveness of ambient light display (ALD) concepts communicating remaining time and system status when engaged in visually distracting NDRAs. In the first study with 21 participants, a traffic light color-coded ALD concept (LED stripe positioned at the bottom of the windshield) was compared to a baseline concept in two subsequent drives. Subjects were asked to rate usability, workload, trust, and their use of travel time after each drive. Furthermore, gaze data and NDRA disengagement timing was analyzed. The ALD with three discrete time steps led to improved usability ratings and lower workload levels compared to the baseline interface without any ALD. No significant effects on trust, attention ratio, travel time evaluation, and NDRA continuation were found, but a vast majority favored the ALD. Due to this positive evaluation, the traffic light ALD concept was subsequently improved and compared to an elapsing concept in a subsequent study with 32 participants. In addition to the first study, the focus was on the intuitiveness of the developed concepts. In a similar setting, results revealed no significant differences between the ALD concepts in subjective ratings (workload, usability, trust, travel time ratings), but advantages of the traffic light concept can be found in terms of its intuitiveness and the level of support experienced.","Automated driving, User information needs, Ambient light displays, Non-driving related activities",Tobias Hecht and Stefanie Weng and Luca-Felix Kick and Klaus Bengler,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000850,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103762,0003-6870,2022,103762,103,Applied Ergonomics,How users of automated vehicles benefit from predictive ambient light displays,article,HECHT2022103762
"Despite the lack of haptic feedback, two-finger typing remains as a common freehand mid-air text entry method in VR. To compensate for this limitation, we investigated the effect of pseudo-haptics and thumb-to-finger pinch self-haptics. Three types of virtual keyboards were developed for comparison: a normal virtual keyboard without any haptic features, a pseudo-haptic keyboard providing a haptic illusion by adding pseudo-haptic features to the normal virtual keyboard, and a pinch keyboard providing passive self-haptic feedback when the index finger touches the thumb to type bubble-shaped keys. A follow-up user study was conducted on the three keyboards to measure typing performance, perceived workload, and user experience. The results showed that the pseudo-haptic and pinch keyboards were comparable to the normal one in typing performance and workload, but beneficial in user experience and preference. The findings suggest that pseudo-haptics and self-haptics could achieve experiential benefits in VR text entry without obtrusive extra devices.","Virtual reality, Text entry, Mid-air interaction, Haptic feedback, Keyboard",Woojoo Kim and Shuping Xiong,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001429,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103819,0003-6870,2022,103819,104,Applied Ergonomics,Pseudo-haptics and self-haptics for freehand mid-air text entry in VR,article,KIM2022103819
"Effects of psychosocial hazards on risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are often very substantial, but workplace risk management practices focus largely on biomechanical hazards, as do the risk assessment methods used by ergonomists. Translation of research evidence into more effective workplace practices demands a more holistic risk management framework that encompasses both types of hazard. In this context, we evaluate the validity of different MSD risk assessment methods for different purposes, focusing particularly on requirements for routine workplace risk management. These include choice of fit-for-purpose assessment methods, prioritisation of hazards that are most affecting risk, and control actions as high as possible in the risk control hierarchy. Ergonomists could facilitate more effective workplace risk management by promoting: awareness of the need for change; improvements to guidance from OHS regulators; research on MSD-related workplace management issues; and professional development programs on this topic for ergonomists and other OHS practitioners.","Musculoskeletal disorders, Valid risk assessment, Workplace risk management",Wendy Macdonald and Jodi Oakman,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000977,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103774,0003-6870,2022,103774,103,Applied Ergonomics,The problem with â??ergonomics injuriesâ?: What can ergonomists do?,article,MACDONALD2022103774
"The special characteristics of the cleaning industry have an important impact on the health and safety of its workforce. Making use of data from more than 79,000 occupational accidents, the aim of the present research is to use machine learning techniques to develop a model to predict incapacity for work (expressed in days of absence) due to work-related overexertion injuries among service sector cleaners in Spain. The severity of accidents caused by overexertion depends on several factors that can be classified into the following categories: injury typology, individual factors, employment conditions, accident circumstances and health and safety management and standards in the company.","Work-related overexertion injuries, Absenteeism, Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), Cleaning sector, Machine learning",Aroa {GonzÃ¡lez Fuentes} and NÃ©lida M. {Busto Serrano} and Fernando {SÃ¡nchez Lasheras} and Gregorio {Fidalgo Valverde} and Ana {SuÃ¡rez SÃ¡nchez},https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001703,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103847,0003-6870,2022,103847,105,Applied Ergonomics,Work-related overexertion injuries in cleaning occupations: An exploration of the factors to predict the days of absence by means of machine learning methodologies,article,GONZALEZFUENTES2022103847
"Multimodal interaction (MMI) is being widely implemented, especially in new technologies such as augmented reality (AR) systems since it is presumed to support a more natural, efficient, and flexible form of interaction. However, limited research has been done to investigate the proper application of MMI in AR. More specifically, the effects of combining different input and output modalities during MMI in AR are still not fully understood. Therefore, this study aims to examine the independent and combined effects of different input and output modalities during a typical AR task. 20 young adults participated in a controlled experiment in which they were asked to perform a simple identification task using an AR device in different input (speech, gesture, multimodal) and output (VV-VA, VV-NA, NV-VA, NV-NA) conditions. Results showed that there were differences in the influence of input and output modalities on task performance, workload, perceived appropriateness, and user preference. Interaction effects between the input and output conditions on the performance metrics were also evident in this study, suggesting that although multimodal input is generally preferred by the users, it should be implemented with caution since its effectiveness is highly influenced by the processing code of the system output. This study, which is the first of its kind, has revealed several new implications regarding the application of MMI in AR systems.","Multimodal interaction, Sensory modalities, Processing codes, Modality combination, Augmented reality",May Jorella Lazaro and Jaeyong Lee and Jaemin Chun and Myung Hwan Yun and Sungho Kim,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702200165X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103842,0003-6870,2022,103842,105,Applied Ergonomics,Multimodal interaction: Input-output modality combinations for identification tasks in augmented reality,article,LAZARO2022103842
"This paper presents a comparison of four common Human Reliability Assessment (HRA) models through a scoping literature review and sensitivity analysis. The scoping literature review identified 72 relevant studies which formed the basis of the comparison. Studies reported the four selected models have similarities in terms of the sector of origin, applied sectors, output calculation, and a lack of clear guidelines on Performance Influencing Factors (PIFs) selection and risk level allocation. The studied models have differences in the number and type of PIF inputs and Human Error Probability (HEP) calculation procedures. The One Factor At a Time (OFAT) and â??combinedâ? sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the HRA modelsâ?? responses to systematic risk level changes when each of 8 matching PIFs were systematically set to â??highâ? and then â??lowâ? levels individually and simultaneously. The OFAT analysis showed coefficients of variation (CV) in HEP varying from 9% for skills/training up to 94% for work procedure when the PIFs are assigned to a â??lowâ? risk level individually. The combined analysis showed the median HEP value close to 97% and 1% when PIFs are assigned toâ? highâ? and â??lowâ? risk levels respectively. Although the selected HRA models were reported to be validated in high-risk domains there was no study found that validated these models in low-risk domains such as manual order picking, or manual assembly lines. The HRA models examined here are disconnected from specific system design elements which can inhibit design improvement efforts. The study outcome suggests the need for clear guidelines for PIFs selection and risk level allocation. Future research should address both the connection of error assessment to the design of the system and the features of new HRA models that affect its reliability and validity in a variety of industrial contexts.","Human error, Human error probability, Performance shaping factors, Human factors, Ergonomics",Azin Setayesh and Valentina {Di Pasquale} and W.

"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of workstation adjustment to reduce postural exposure and perceived discomfort among office workers in a cluster randomized controlled trial. Experimental (EG, nÂ =Â 31) and control groups (CG, nÂ =Â 30) were compared before (pre-intervention), immediately (post-intervention), and 3 months after (follow up) the intervention. EG received workstation adjustments and CG did not received the intervention. Postural exposure of head, upper back and upper arms was objectively measured by inclinometers. Overall level of perceived discomfort for the whole body was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (0â??100Â mm). EG showed a statistically significant reduction on the head (pre: 10.1Â°, SD 5.7Â°; post: 6.6Â°, SD 4.7Â°) and upper back flexion (pre: 15.4Â°, SD 10.7Â°; post: 10.4Â°, SD 8.4Â°) from pre to post-intervention. EG also showed a statistically significant reduction from pre (50.7Â°, SD 9.5Â°) to post-intervention (42.1Â°, SD 7.6Â°) and from pre to follow up (41.6Â°, SD 6.5Â°) on upper arm elevation. CG did not show any difference between evaluations. Perceived discomfort increased 7.2 (SD 2.0) mm in CG and decreased 22.1 (SD 2.2) mm in EG between pre and post intervention. The variation between pre intervention and follow up was 4.5 (SD 1.2) mm increase for the CG and 24.1 (SD 1.5) mm of reduction for the EG (PÂ <Â 0.01). There was no significant difference for the post intervention and follow up for both groups (PÂ >Â 0.05).

"Traditional insole materials which trap heat and moisture inside footwear cause discomfort to the wearer. Here, a novel textile-fabricated insole material with a 3D structure that offers good porosity and breathability for improving the footwear microclimate is proposed. Changes in foot skin temperature and humidity when wearing the textile-fabricated insole throughout treadmill walking are collected from 21 female subjects (age: 25.5Â Â±Â 4.5) and compared with traditional and 3D printed insoles. Subjective assessment of their perceived thermal comfort with various insole conditions is also conducted. In comparison to polyurethane, 3D printed thermoplastic polyurethane and leather insoles, textile-fabricated insoles show no significant changes in foot skin temperature. Nevertheless, a significant reduction of the relative humidity of the skin of the sole (3.21%) and heel (24.41%) is found. The findings are a valuable reference for the fabrication of insoles with higher wear comfort.","Max 3): insole, Footwear, Thermal comfort",Karolyn Ning and Kit-Lun Yick and Annie Yu and Joanne Yip,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001260,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103803,0003-6870,2022,103803,104,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of textile-fabricated insole on foot skin temperature and humidity for enhancing footwear thermal comfort,article,NING2022103803
"Objective This study aims to investigate the benefits of unimodal tactile displays relative to other modal displays and the performance gains of adding redundant tactile displays by integrating empirical studies. Background Tactile displays have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their unique advantages. Synthesizing experimental data is necessary to analyze the performance benefits of tactile displays for participants and better help practitioners in utilizing them. Method Five meta-analyses were conducted. Two meta-analyses compared the participantsâ?? performance between tactile and other modal displays (visual vs. tactile and auditory vs. tactile). Three meta-analyses examined the performance gains of adding redundant tactile displays based on other modal displays (visual vs. visualÂ +Â tactile, auditory vs. auditoryÂ +Â tactile, and visualÂ +Â auditory vs. visualÂ +Â auditoryÂ +Â tactile). The related moderator variables, the types of presented information and concurrent tasks, were analyzed. Results Little evidence shows the performance difference between tactile and auditory displays. Tactile displays are more beneficial than visual displays for presenting alert information or in the situation with a visual concurrent task. The performance gains of adding redundant tactile displays to other modal displays also depend on the specific type of presented information and the concurrent task. Conclusion When using tactile displays to convey information, interface designers should consider the specific type of presented information and the concurrent tasks. Applications The present study's findings can provide some implications for designers to utilize tactile displays when they construct and implement information displays.","Tactile display, Visual display, Auditory display, Redundant multimodal display, Humanâ??computer interaction, Meta-analysis",Chunlei Chai and Jinlei Shi and Changxu Wu and Youcheng Zhou and Wei Zhang and Jing Liao,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001259,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103802,0003-6870,2022,103802,103,Applied Ergonomics,When to use vibrotactile displays?

In this paper, we describe three cases presented at the 21st Triennial Congress of the International Ergonomics Association to demonstrate how HFE has been applied during the COVID-19 pandemic, namely to (1) develop a mobile diagnostic testing system, (2) understand the changes within physiotherapy services, and (3) guide the transition of a perioperative pain program to telemedicine. We reflect on methodological choices and lessons learned from each case and discuss opportunities to expand the impact of HFE in responses to future emergencies. The HFE discipline should develop faster, less resource intensive but still rigorous, methods, increase available HFE expertise by growing the field, and proactively enhance individual and public perception of the importance of HFE in crisis response.","1.

"Automated vehicles (AVs) can perform low-level control tasks but are not always capable of proper decision-making. This paper presents a concept of eye-based maneuver control for AV-pedestrian interaction. Previously, it was unknown whether the AV should conduct a stopping maneuver when the driver looks at the pedestrian or looks away from the pedestrian. A two-agent experiment was conducted using two head-mounted displays with integrated eye-tracking. Seventeen pairs of participants (pedestrian and driver) each interacted in a road crossing scenario. The pedestrians' task was to hold a button when they felt safe to cross the road, and the drivers' task was to direct their gaze according to instructions. Participants completed three 16-trial blocks: (1) Baseline, in which the AV was pre-programmed to yield or not yield, (2) Look to Yield (LTY), in which the AV yielded when the driver looked at the pedestrian, and (3) Look Away to Yield (LATY), in which the AV yielded when the driver did not look at the pedestrian. The driver's eye movements in the LTY and LATY conditions were visualized using a virtual light beam. Crossing performance was assessed based on whether the pedestrian held the button when the AV yielded and released the button when the AV did not yield. Furthermore, the pedestrians' and drivers' acceptance of the mappings was measured through a questionnaire. The results showed that the LTY and LATY mappings yielded better crossing performance than Baseline. Furthermore, the LTY condition was best accepted by drivers and pedestrians. Eye-tracking analyses indicated that the LTY and LATY mappings attracted the pedestrian's attention, while pedestrians still distributed their attention between the AV and a second vehicle approaching from the other direction. In conclusion, LTY control may be a promising means of AV control at intersections before full automation is technologically feasible.","Intent communication, Virtual reality, Eye-tracking, AV-Pedestrian interaction, Multi-agent interaction",Chun Sang Mok and Pavlo Bazilinskyy and Joost {de Winter},https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702200148X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103825,0003-6870,2022,103825,105,Applied Ergonomics,Stopping by looking: A driver-pedestrian interaction study in a coupled simulator using head-mounted displays with eye-tracking,article,MOK2022103825
"This study aimed to investigate the effects of different tools and working heights on physical workloads in vertical cleaning tasks. Thirty healthy adults were recruited to use a rag and a long-handle tool (LHT) to simulate cleaning operations on the Wii Fit board surfaces of 3 different heights, respectively. Participants used a lower 50th percentile force but were required to spend a longer time to finish the task while using an LHT than using a rag. The tool preferences were the main factors considered for efficiency and personal subjective workload and physiological load. 76.6% of the participants preferred to use the LHT instead of the rag at a high task height, but 70% preferred to use the rag when working at a medium task height. For low workload cleaning tasks on vertical surfaces, employers should provide cleaners with different handle lengths tools to choose from to reduce the cleaner's workload.","Vertical cleaning task, Simulation task environment, Physical workload",Yung-Ping Liu and Hsieh-Ching Chen and Wei-Hsien Hong and Wei-Chun Weng,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001417,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103818,0003-6870,2022,103818,104,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of different tools and working height on physical workload in vertical cleaning tasks applying ambient control techniques,article,LIU2022103818
"Technological advancements have increased occupational flexibility for employees and employers alike. However, while effective telework requires planning, the COVID-19 pandemic required many employees to quickly shift to working from home without ensuring that the requirements for telework were in place. This study evaluated the transition to telework on university faculty and staff and investigated the effect of one's telework setup and ergonomics training on work-related discomfort in the at-home environment. Fifty-one percent of respondents reported increases in their existing discomfort while 24% reported new discomfort since working from home.

"Objective The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of a secondary motor task induced by an interactive seating system (IASS) on passive driver fatigue in a monotonous simulated driving task. The effect was compared to that of a state-of-the-art massage seating system (MS), which may reduce monotony through additional tactile stimuli. The secondary objective was to compare the user experience of both systems. Method The independent variables were three conditions: one with the IASS, another with the MS, and a control without intervention. The study included seven dependent variables in total: a rating of subjective fatigue, three parameters measuring lane keeping ability, and three parameters reflecting fatigue-related eye movements. The duration of the simulator ride was 40Â min in each condition. The study included thirty-five subjects. Results The assessment of subjective fatigue and lane keeping showed that the use of the IASS resulted in significantly lower passive driver fatigue compared to the massage and control conditions. The alerting effects of the IASS were also reflected by an increased eyelid distance. Frequency and duration of blinks, however, showed no clear patterns of fatigue over time in any of the conditions. Thus, both parameters did not seem be suitable to capture passive driver fatigue in this study. Regarding user experience, the subjects preferred the IASS over the MS as well. Conclusion The IASS showed a strong potential as an effective measure against passive driver fatigue within monotonous driving situations. The MS, on the other hand, induced no measurable effects.","Interactive seating system, Active seating, Mental fatigue, Sustained attention, Driver vigilance, Passive driver fatigue, Partial automation",Dario Lampe and Barbara Deml,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000965,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103773,0003-6870,2022,103773,103,Applied Ergonomics,Reducing passive driver fatigue through a suitable secondary motor task by means of an interactive seating system,article,LAMPE2022103773
"Work stress may compromise professional driversâ?? health and driving capacity. Differences between driver groups in terms of on-duty stress are understudied. Therefore, we examined self-reported stress (Stockholm University Stress Scale) of shift-working tram and long-haul truck drivers (nÂ =Â 75) across 2â??3 weeks. Furthermore, stressors were self-reported retrospectively and categorised as related to the job, driving conditions, personal, or other causes. Stress levels were generally low, but moderate to high stress (â?¥6) was more frequently reported among the tram drivers. Stressors related to the job (54%) and driving conditions (19% of all shifts) were frequently reported among the tram and truck drivers, respectively. Moderate to high stress was associated with categorised stressors related to the job and other causes among the tram drivers, and all categorised stressors among the truck drivers. Altogether, self-reported stress and stressors differ by driver group, but the role of shift type is less significant.","Stress, Shift work, Driving",Jussi Onninen and Mia PylkkÃ¶nen and Tarja Hakola and Sampsa Puttonen and Jussi Virkkala and Asko Tolvanen and Mikael Sallinen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000849,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103761,0003-6870,2022,103761,102,Applied Ergonomics,The self-reported stress and stressors in tram and long-haul truck drivers,article,ONNINEN2022103761
"To teach a skilled motor task, it is crucial to understand the characteristics of expertise. The aim of the present study was to compare the kinematics of the hand sewing task between novices (nÂ =Â 10), intermediates (nÂ =Â 10) and experts (nÂ =Â 10). Compared to novices and intermediates, the proximal joint of expert participants was less involved in the task than their distal joints. The shoulder of experts stayed closer to the trunk, while the ranges of motion of the wrist and fingers were higher. This ability enabled them to avoid lifting the arm, which was resting on the table. We observed a low cycle-to-cycle variability of the movement pattern for experts, while it was more variable in novices. Moreover, experts shared similar joints synergies attesting of an â??expertsâ? common gesture.

"The objective of this paper is to analyze the existing literature to determine the scope and risk factors of slips, trips, and falls (STFs) within the janitorial population in order to make evidence-based recommendations to prevent these incidents in the future. Selected for review were published peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings, and gray literature relating to STFs among janitors and cleaners. Individuals employed as janitors and cleaners, specifically those that were older than 45-years of age and/or female, represented the highest risk populations for STFs. These STFs result in injuries, such as sprains, strains, dislocations, and tears. Among janitors and cleaners, 30% of nonfatal incidents are attributed to STFs, resulting in a median of 11 days away from work. Both non-observable/human factors and observable/organizational factors contribute to STFs within this population and must be addressed to protect public health. Preventive interventions focused on comprehensive approaches that target observable and non-observable factors are needed to reduce STFs within the custodial population. More research is needed on STFs in the janitorial population to identify successful preventive STF interventions. Addressing the issue of STFs within this job classification will improve the overall health and well-being of janitors as well as reduce the indirect and direct economic burden placed on the employer organization.","Slips and falls, Trips, Occupational injury, Fall prevention, Cleaner, Janitor",Savannah Bitzas and Shannon Ma and Kelly Pesanelli and Ann M.

"The goal of this study was to quantify and compare prospective self-reported intraoperative workload and teamwork during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for multi-port da Vinci Xi (MP) and single-port da Vinci SP (SP) robots.

Results from 25Â MP and SP RARPs showed that overall, the NASA-TLX workload subscales were lower, and the teamwork modified NOTECHS subscales were higher for the MP RARPs compared to the SP RARPs. The underlying reason for the significant differences between these two RARP surgical procedures could be other factors (e.g., robot design factors) in addition to the surgeon and surgical team's experience. The results also suggested learning effects through the 25 SP RARPs; however, twenty-five procedures may not be enough to achieve proficiency with the SP system.","Robotic surgery, Operating room workload, Teamwork",Hamid Norasi and Emmanuel Tetteh and Katherine E.

The framework is used to identify the performed task as the major contextual risk factor, and then estimate the task duration and number of repetitions as two main indicators of task intensity. For evaluation of the framework, we recruited 37 participants to complete 10 simulated work tasks in a laboratory setting. In testing, we achieved an average accuracy of 92% for task identification, 7.3% error in estimation of task duration, and 7.1% error for counting the number of task repetitions. Moreover, we showed the utility of the framework outputs in two ergonomic tools to estimate the risk of injury. Overall, we indicated the feasibility of using data from wearable sensors to automate the ergonomic risk assessment in workplaces.","Human performance modeling, Ergonomic risk assessment, End-to-end learning, Change point detection, Wavelets, Wearable sensors",Saeb Ragani Lamooki and Sahand Hajifar and Jiyeon Kang and Hongyue Sun and Fadel M.

"Eye-gaze and head-gaze are two hands-free interaction modes in virtual reality, each of which has demonstrated different strengths. Selecting suitable interaction modes in different scenarios is important to achieve efficient interaction in virtual scenes. This study compared the movement time in an object positioning task by examining eye-gaze interaction and head-gaze interaction in various conditions. In turn, it identified the superior zones for each mode, respectively. Based on this information, we designed a combination mode â?? utilizing eye-gaze interaction at the acceleration phase and deceleration phase and head-gaze interaction at the correction phase â?? to achieve the optimal interaction mode, which has allowed us to obtain higher efficiency and subjective satisfaction. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of the eye-gaze and head-gaze interaction modes and provides valuable insights into selecting the appropriate interaction modes for virtual reality applications.","Distal positioning, Gaze interaction, Movement trajectory, Virtual reality",Cheng-Long Deng and Chen-Yu Tian and Shu-Guang Kuai,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001089,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103785,0003-6870,2022,103785,103,Applied Ergonomics,A combination of eye-gaze and head-gaze interactions improves efficiency and user experience in an object positioning task in virtual environments,article,DENG2022103785
"The purpose of this study was to work systematically through all known measures for preventing railway suicides and to consider their suitability for the Finnish railway environment. The research method included a selection and grouping of measures, definition of assessment criteria, a literature review and compilation of assessment forms, and a workshop for experts in the field. We assessed 21 measures based on 12 specified criteria. Specifically, the aim of these criteria was to support the identification and structuring of the available information on each measure to be in easily exploitable format for railway stakeholders. The measures were listed in order of priority in three categories based on final assessments from the workshop. The measures categorised as top priority with the highest potential to reduce suicides on Finnish railways included training of railway personnel to identify suicidal people (also called Gatekeeper training), camera surveillance, detection systems (radar, movement sensors, etc.), collaboration between organisations, learning from international experience, cooperation between railway organisations, police and fire and rescue services, and training of mental health providers. This prioritisation, together with the information included in the assessment forms and expert's views related to each measure, support the Finnish railway stakeholders in selecting measures and defining implementation strategies to prevent railway suicides on Finnish railways. The insights of Finnish experts on the effectiveness and potential implementation of these different measures are valuable information also for railway stakeholders in other countries when selecting appropriate measures to prevent railway suicides. The results of this study support the safe and effective functioning of the railway system by adding knowledge that will help effectively prevent railway suicides and loss of life, delays to train traffic, and work-related stress and trauma to railway staff, rescue personnel and eyewitnesses.","Railway suicides, Prevention, Expert assessment",Anne Silla,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000710,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103748,0003-6870,2022,103748,102,Applied Ergonomics,Identifying measures with the highest potential to reduce suicides on Finnish railways,article,SILLA2022103748
"Passengers' travel behaviour is one of the significant factors affecting train overcrowding. Train occupancy information has been introduced as a tool to stimulate passengers' behaviour change to ease in-vehicle crowding. However, there are limitations to this strategy as it often fails to consider other elements in the complex rail system that influence behaviour. This research provides insights to service providers to promote passenger behaviour change by revealing the behavioural constraints in the environment. Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) was applied to systematically analyse passengersâ?? behaviour and related constraints in the environment. Specifically, Work Domain Analysis (WDA) and Social Organisation and Cooperation Analysis (SOCA) were conducted and presented in the forms of Abstraction Hierarchy (AH) and Contextual Activity Template (CAT). Results showed that a wide range of informational, navigational and physical support alongside provision of occupancy information could better encourage passengers to select and use less busy carriages and trains. Behaviour change goals are likely to be achieved more effectively when the constraints of the system are better understood.","Cognitive work analysis, Train crowding, Occupancy information, Passenger behaviour change",Jisun Kim and Kirsten Madeira-Revell and John Preston,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001247,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103801,0003-6870,2022,103801,104,Applied Ergonomics,Promoting passenger behaviour change with provision of occupancy information to help moderate train overcrowding: A cognitive work analysis approach,article,KIM2022103801
"Objective Investigate the influence of sex, strength capacity, and relative load mass on low-back exposure and lower extremity joint power generation in backboard lifting. Background Sex and strength have been shown to influence lifting strategy, but without load mass being scaled to strength it is unknown which factor influences low-back exposures, and whether there are interactions with load mass. Methods Motion capture and force plate data from 28 participants were collected during backboard lifting at load masses scaled to strength capacity. Differences in normalized peak low-back moment, peak knee-to-hip power magnitude ratio and timing were tested as a function of sex, strength, and load mass. Results Stronger participants had lower normalized peak low-back moments (average 32% change from low-capacity across all load masses), with no significant sex effect (pÂ =Â 0.582). As load mass increased, normalized peak low-back moment, peak knee-to-hip power magnitude and synchronicity decreased. Conclusion Training to both increase strength capacity and hip-joint power generation may be a strategy to reduce low-back exposure in backboard lifting.","Strength capacity, Energetics, Paramedics",David Clusiault and Justin B.

"Given there is no unifying theory or design guidance for workload transitions, this work investigated how visual attention allocation patterns could inform both topics, by understanding if scan-based eye tracking metrics could predict workload transition performance trends in a context-relevant domain. The eye movements of sixty Naval flight students were tracked as workload transitioned at a slow, medium, and fast pace in an unmanned aerial vehicle testbed. Four scan-based metrics were significant predictors across the different growth curve models of response time and accuracy. Stationary gaze entropy (a measure of how dispersed visual attention transitions are across tasks) was predictive across all three transition rates. The other three predictive scan-based metrics captured different aspects of visual attention, including its spread, directness, and duration. The findings specify several missing details in both theory and design guidance, which is unprecedented, and serves as a basis of future workload transition research.","Workload transitions, Eye tracking, Growth curve modeling, Supervisory control",Shannon P.

"Sensor type (accelerometers only versus inertial measurement units, IMUs) and angular velocity computational method (inclination versus generalized velocity) have been shown to affect the measurements of arm and trunk movements. This study developed models for conversions between accelerometer and IMU measurements of arm and trunk inclination and between accelerometer and IMU measurements of inclination and generalized (arm) velocities. Full-workday recordings from accelerometers and IMUs of arm and trunk postures and movements from 38 warehouse workers were used to develop 4 angular (posture) and 24 angular velocity (movement) conversion models for the distributions of the data. A power function with one coefficient and one exponent was used, and it correlated well (r2Â >Â 0.999) in all cases to the average curves comparing one measurement with another. These conversion models facilitate the comparison and merging of measurements of arm and trunk movements collected using the two sensor types and the two computational methods.","Inertial measurement unit, Field measurement, Sensor conversion",Mikael Forsman and Xuelong Fan and Ida-MÃ¤rta Rhen and Carl Mikael Lind,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001648,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103841,0003-6870,2022,103841,105,Applied Ergonomics,Mind the gap â?? development of conversion models between accelerometer- and IMU-based measurements of arm and trunk postures and movements in warehouse work,article,FORSMAN2022103841
"This study examined associations between metrics of noise exposure and mental workload. In this cross-sectional study, five occupational noise metrics computed from full-shift dosimetry were evaluated among surface mine workers in the US Midwest. Mental workload was evaluated using a modified, raw NASA-TLX and clustered with a k-means clustering algorithm. Mixed effects logistic regression and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) was utilized for analysis. Average noise exposure, the difference between peak and mean noise exposure, and the number of peaks >135Â dB were each strongly associated with mental workload, while the kurtosis and standard deviation of noise throughout a shift were not. An exposure-response relationship between average noise exposure and mental workload may exist, with elevated risk of high mental workload beginning at 80 dBA. These results suggest that high noise exposure may be an independent risk factor of high mental workload, and impulse events and the difference between the peak and mean noise exposure may have interactive effects with average noise exposure.","Occupational noise exposure, NASA-TLX, BKMR, Miners",Abas Shkembi and Lauren M.

"Objective To test six different methods of directing a user's attention in a peripheral head mounted display assisted visual search task. Background Each time a user needs to shift their attention between virtual information and their environment has a cost. The faster a user can process a guiding cue and the fewer times they need to return to it, the more efficient that cue will be at directing a user's attention. The most effective method, creating a visual effect at the location of the target, is not suitable for peripheral head mounted displays. This study tests alternative guiding cues better suited to these devices. Method Participants searched for a singleton target hidden among 299 distractors while directed with one of six device-delivered guiding cues. Search times were recorded. Results A static region map was the most efficient and most preferred cue. Static and dynamic directional cues were also effective in comparison to non-guided search. Cues designed to work solely within the participantsâ?? peripheral vision were relatively ineffective Conclusion Guidance cues that direct a user's attention to targets within the real environment do not need to precisely lead to the target. It is instead more efficient to lead a user to the general vicinity of the target quickly and then have the user revert to their natural visual search behaviour. Application This finding is broadly useful when assisting visual search tasks with handheld or worn devices which do not cover the user's full field of view. PrÃ©cis This study tested six different methods of guiding attention in a peripheral head-mounted display assisted visual search task. This study compared static, dynamic and peripheral-vision endogenous cues to targets and found a static simple map cue both fastest and most preferred by users.","Attention, Head-mounted display, Mobile devices, Visual search, Wearable devices",Matthew Ward and William S.

"Wrist actigraph and self-report activity logs were used in a Royal Canadian Navy's at-sea exercise to track sleep patterns of naval personnel. In this study, we compared sleep parameters obtained from two measurement methods and investigated their intrinsic biases. The results revealed a strong agreement between two methods for recording sleep offset times, but a relatively poor agreement for parameters that include substantial periods of transition between sleep and wake states. Overall, self-reported sleep durations were substantially longer than actigraphic estimates (mean bias of â??30.6Â min; limits of agreement â??95.9 to 34.8Â min), and the discrepancy was mainly caused by differences in two methods to track sleep onset latency and Wake-up After Sleep Onset (WASO). Based on a customised activity log, a strong positive correlation (rhoÂ =Â 0.75, pÂ <Â .001) between self-report and actigraphy was observed for sleep duration estimates, which confirmed the effectiveness of the activity log in field studies. Between two participant groups with different work schedules, the agreement between self-report and actigraphy was consistently better for day workers than watch keepers. The findings inform future sleep research planning that involves naval personnel in field settings.","Sleep parameter estimate, Actigraphy, Self-report",Wenbi Wang and Henry Peng and Fethi Bouak,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000679,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103744,0003-6870,2022,103744,102,Applied Ergonomics,Measuring sleep parameters of naval sailors: A comparison between subjective self-report and wrist actigraphy,article,WANG2022103744
"Objective To assess whether the capacity to utilize cues amongst emergency physicians is associated with differences in the capacity to recover performance following an interruption. Background Interruptions are implicated in errors in emergency medicine due to the cognitive load that they impose on working memory, resulting in a loss of performance on the primary task. The utilization of cues is associated with a reduction in cognitive load during the performance of a task, thereby enabling the allocation of residual resources that mitigates the loss of performance following interruptions. Method Thirty-nine emergency physicians, recruited at a medical conference, completed an assessment of cue utilization (EXPERTise 2.0) and an online simulation (Septris) that involved the management of patients presenting with sepsis. During the simulation, physicians were interrupted and asked to check a medication order. Task performance was assessed using scores on Septris, with points awarded for the accurate management of patients. Results Emergency physicians with higher cue utilization recorded significantly higher scores on the simulation task following the interruption, compared to physicians with lower cue utilization (pÂ =Â .028). Conclusion The results confirm a relationship between cue utilization and the recovery of performance following an interruption. This is likely due to the advantages afforded by associated reductions in cognitive load.

"Using traditional back tables (BT) in operating rooms (OR) can lead to high physical/cognitive demand on nurses due to repetitive manual material handling activities. A multi-tier table (MTT) has been developed to relieve such stressors by providing extra working surfaces to avoid stacking the instrument trays and facilitate access to surgical tools. In this study, sixteen participants performed lifting/lowering and instrument findings tasks on each table, where kinematics, kinetics, subjective, and performance-related measures were recorded. Results indicated that MTT required lesser shoulder flexion (p-value<0.001), â?¼14% lower shoulder loads (0.012), task completion time (<0.001), and cognitive/physical workloads (<0.004). Although peak low-back demands were â?¼15% higher using MTT, the number of lifts to complete the same task was 60% lower, leading to lower cumulative demand on the low-back musculature. Utilizing MTT in OR could reduce demand and increase nurses' efficiency, leading to reduced risk of WMSDs and the total time of surgery.","Operating room, Perioperative nurses, Biomechanics, Manual material handling, Low-back pain, Musculoskeletal disorders, Wearable sensors",Ketan Thakur and Pranav {Madhav Kuber} and Masoud Abdollahi and Ehsan Rashedi,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702200151X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103828,0003-6870,2022,103828,105,Applied Ergonomics,Why multi-tier surgical instrument table matters?

"Objective We examined the impact of performing a cognitive task of varying loads and kayaking simultaneously, compared to performance on the same tasks individually. Background When two tasks are performed together, performance often suffers compared to performance on either task alone. Interference not only occurs in competing cognitive tasks, but has also been found with certain physically demanding activities, such as climbing. Method Skilled kayakers performed a kayak course on open water, performed a high and a low cognitive load tone counting task, and also performed the kayak and counting tasks simultaneously. Results Despite some past research finding dual task facilitation with laboratory aerobic activities, simultaneous kayaking and tone counting led to dual-task interference. Conclusion Concurrent counting and kayaking led to performance impairments in both tasks, relative to single task performance. Application The present results are applicable to occupations involving concurrent demanding physical activity and cognitive task performance, such as the work of first responders and military operators.

"Chronic pain affects one in five Australians, and this could impact daily activities such as driving. Driving is a complex task, which requires the cognitive and physical ability to predict, identify, and respond to hazards to avoid crashing. However, research exploring the factors that influence safe driving behaviour for chronic pain individuals is limited. A qualitative study was conducted which involved semi-structured interviews with 23 people who had experienced persistent pain for at least three months and 17 health professionals who had experience working with individuals with chronic pain. The aim of this study was to obtain a deeper understanding of the experiences and challenges that people with chronic pain may have in their day-to-day driving. Participants were also asked about currently available driving assessments and strategies for individuals with chronic pain in the Australian healthcare system. The themes emerging from the interviews highlighted the need for clearer guidelines and educational materials regarding the impact of chronic pain on an individual's ability to drive. These themes included the physical and cognitive challenges resulting from chronic pain, as well as the potential side effects of pain medications. In addition, participants identified a number of self-regulation strategies and driving assessments currently available for monitoring safe driving behaviour in Australia. This study improves our understanding of how chronic pain affects driving behaviour, as reported by individuals experiencing the pain and relevant health professionals. Recommendations for improving the safety of drivers with chronic pain are discussed, including possible technological interventions and better public education.","Chronic pain, Self-management, Driving behaviour, Self-regulation strategies, Driving assessment, Distracted driving",Atiyeh Vaezipour and Nicole Andrews and Oscar Oviedo-Trespalacios and Fatima Amershi and Mark Horswill and Venerina Johnston and Patricia Delhomme,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000783,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103755,0003-6870,2022,103755,102,Applied Ergonomics,Exploring driving behaviour from the perspectives of individuals with chronic pain and health professionals,article,VAEZIPOUR2022103755

"This study aimed to determine the interactive physiological effect of backpack load carriage and slope during walking in professional mountain rescuers. Sixteen mountain rescuers walked on a treadmill at 3.6Â km/h for 5Â min in each combination of three slopes (1%, 10%, 20%) and five backpack loads (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% body weight).

Significant differences in %VO2max, %HRmax, and RPE across slopes and loads were found where burden increased directly with slope and load (main effect of slope, pÂ <Â 0.001 for all; main effect of load, pÂ <Â 0.001 for all). Additionally, significant slope by load interactions were found for all parameters, indicating an additive effect (pÂ <Â 0.001 for all).

"The current study analyzed the root causes of 22 helicopter accidents/incidents that took place between 1998 and 2019. Each root cause was coded using three commonly used classification models in aviation HFACS, ATSB, and IATA to identify recurring factors for better targeting of future prevention strategies. The frequency analysis revealed that not following procedure (22 observations), training inadequate or unavailable (17), inadequate regulatory oversight (17), inadequate procedure guidance (16), company management absent or deficient (10) and incorrect manuals/charts/checklists (9) were the most frequent contributing factors. Since none of the existing models could summarize the root causes of 22 occurrences effectively, a scenario-based human-machine-environment-procedure (HMEP) classification scheme was proposed to use organizational influences, people management, technical failure, procedure and document, and environment as the first-layer subcategories. The HMEP scheme was additionally applied to the analysis and coding of 4 helicopter accidents in the USA published by the NTSB. The HMEP scheme revealed that NTSB had identified a significantly greater number of root causes in the manufacturer design, manufacturing & documentation. Overall, HMEP can be used to guide the data collection during accident investigation and subsequently to aggregate aviation accidents to derive recurring factors and compare accident patterns in an efficient manner.","Procedures and documentation, Safety management, ATSB, HFACS, IATA",Chia-Fen Chi and Davin Sigmund and Yu-Chieh Lin and Colin G.

"Introduction Excessive physical shoulder musculoskeletal loading (muscle and joint contact forces), known to contribute to work-related shoulder disorders, can be reduced by a passive shoulder exoskeleton during quasi-static tasks. However, its effect on neighboring joints i.e. elbow, lower back, hip, and knee and its effect on joint contact forces have not been investigated. Furthermore, the effect of the exoskeleton's assistance versus movement adaptation when wearing the exoskeleton on musculoskeletal loading remains unexplored. Methods 3D motion capture and ground reaction forces were measured while 16 participants performed 5 simulated occupational tasks with and without the exoskeleton. A musculoskeletal modeling workflow was used to calculate musculoskeletal loading. Shoulder muscle fatigue was quantified using surface EMG. In addition, exoskeletons usability was quantified using the system usability scale. Results When wearing the passive shoulder exoskeleton, shoulder and elbow musculoskeletal loading decreased during the high lift and overhead wiring task, without increasing the musculoskeletal load at the back, hip and knee. In contrast, musculoskeletal loading in the shoulder, as well as in the knee increased while lifting a box from the ground to knee height and from elbow height to shoulder height. When wearing the exoskeleton, muscle activity of the Trapezius descendens, Deltoideus medius and Biceps brachii were reduced during the high lift. Conclusion The passive shoulder exoskeleton reduces musculoskeletal loading in the lower back, shoulder and elbow during simulated occupational tasks above shoulder height. In contrast, for tasks below shoulder height, the use of the exoskeleton needs to be critically reviewed to avoid increased musculoskeletal loading also in neighboring joints due to altered movement execution when wearing the exoskeleton.","Passive shoulder exoskeleton, Full-body musculoskeletal modeling, Simulated occupational tasks, Muscle fatigue",Arthur {van der Have} and Marco Rossini and Carlos Rodriguez-Guerrero and Sam {Van Rossom} and Ilse Jonkers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001235,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103800,0003-6870,2022,103800,103,Applied Ergonomics,The Exo4Work shoulder exoskeleton effectively reduces muscle and joint loading during simulated occupational tasks above shoulder height,article,VANDERHAVE2022103800
"Heat stress is associated with workplace injuries, likely through a combination of fatigue, reduced cognitive function, and thermal discomfort. The purpose of this study was to evaluate four cognitive tasks for sensitivity to heat stress. Eight participants performed treadmill exercise followed by assessments of serial reaction time (RT), Stroop effect, verbal delayed memory, and continuous performance working memory in an environmental chamber. A control (21.1Â Â°C) trial, and â??Hot 1â? and â??Hot 2â? (both 37.8Â Â°C) trials were run sequentially on two separate days to evaluate the four cognitive tasks. Heat strain (comparing Hot 1 and Hot 2 with the control trial) resulted in impairments in the serial RT test response and Stroop accuracy. Delayed memory was impacted only in the Hot 2 trial compared with the control trial. Given the demonstrated impact of heat on cognitive processes relevant to workersâ?? real-world functioning in the workplace, understanding how to assess and monitor vigilant attention in the workplace is essential.","Heat stress, Cognitive",Kristin Yeoman and Alyssa Weakley and Weston DuBose and Kimberly Honn and Timothy McMurry and Brianna Eiter and Brent Baker and Gerald Poplin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000667,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103743,0003-6870,2022,103743,102,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of heat strain on cognitive function among a sample of miners,article,YEOMAN2022103743
"We assessed whether training on writing readable and accurate medical incident reports (IRs) improves the quality of fact description. In this training, 124 residents created fictional IRs. We provided tips, including using When, Where, Who, What, Why, How. We compared the fictional IRs with and without tips, and the trainees' and non-traineesâ?? IRs submitted in the first five months after training. Results indicated that the subject words in IRs were more clarified and the readability was improved. The fictional IRs using tips were more accurate, with increased descriptions of the patient's background, reporter's actions, team members' actions and conversations, safety check procedures, result of the error, and post-incident response. The reporter's actions, work procedures, and environment were more clarified in the trainees' IRs than in the non-traineesâ?? IRs.

"The scale and pace of improvement in patient safety in healthcare has been unacceptably slow. A paucity of research into the application of systems-thinking concepts and a failure to appreciate health systems complexity are cited as barriers to sustainable health systems improvement. This study reports on a socio-technical systems analysis, called the CUBE, of the characteristics of a large acute teaching hospital's system for the transport of precious specimens, a system enabled by radio-frequency identification tracking technology. The CUBE proved itself to be an effective analytic tool. The analysis provided a constructive framework to link diverse data and documentation; explicitly inviting consideration of the roles and understandings of different stakeholders; as well as broader cultural factors that could influence current or future activity. The analysis also supported recommendations to improve and extend operations. This study supports the argument for systems understanding and systems thinking being at the core of new approaches to patient safety.","Socio-technical systems analysis, RFID, Acute hospital",Una Geary and Marie E.

"Background Most adults prefer to age in place. However, the majority of homes are not designed to support resident needs, especially for adults undergoing joint replacement surgeries such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). It is of paramount importance to proactively assess and modify the homes of adults undergoing TKA/THA such that they can safely transition home following surgery. Several tools utilize emerging technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, or teleconferencing to assess home environments. These are meant to be used by professionals like occupational therapists. However, the acceptance and uptake of simple technology like mobile applications for assessing homes proactively by residents has not been explored. Objective A qualitative exploratory study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and potential acceptance of a mobile application for resident-initiated home assessment. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 patient-care partner dyads before and after THA/TKA to understand the perceived usefulness, likelihood of using a mobile application-based home assessment tool, and perceived barriers and facilitators of using the tool. Results About 68% of the patient-care partner dyads interviewed for this study perceived benefits of using a mobile application-based tool. All the participants who perceived the tool to be useful showed high likelihood of using it. A comparison of responses between pre-and post-surgery interviews revealed that around 50% of participants showed an increased intention of using an assessment tool after experiencing challenges in their homes post-surgery. Participants provided recommendations for key content, potential features to include in the assessment tool, and preferred formats (e.g., checklists, visuals, and videos). Conclusions To increase acceptance of a mobile application-based home assessment tool, it is crucial that residents are made aware of the home environment challenges and the importance of an assessment tool to improve their safety and independence. The content, features, formats, and usability suggestions from the participants in this study provide a framework for health mobile application and interface developers to design a home assessment tool.","Home assessment tool, Mobile application, Joint replacement surgery, Perceived usefulness, Likelihood of use",Rutali Joshi and Anjali Joseph and Sahar Mihandoust and Kapil Chalil Madathil and Shelia R.

"Two types of newly designed pharmaceutical pictograms (with and without context) were compared with an existing type of certified pictograms regarding their search efficiency. Each of the 30 participants had to search a total of 1â?²090 â??fictitiousâ? medical shelves for a certain box defined by the amount and type of medical instructions given (memory size) and presented among a variable number of other boxes (set size). The boxes contained the different types of pictograms mentioned above. Calculated factorial analyses on reaction time data, among others, showed that the two newly designed pictogram types make search more efficient compared to existing types of pictograms (i.e., flatter reaction time x set size slopes). Furthermore, regardless of the type of pictogram, this set size effect became more pronounced with larger memory sizes. Overall, the newly designed pictograms need fewer attentional resources and therefore might help to increase patient adherence.","Pharmaceutical pictogram system, Search efficiency, Medical instructions",Ester Reijnen and Lea {Laasner Vogt} and Jan P.

"As a new intrusion method in the security field, phishing poses an enormous threat to network security and personal privacy. Thus, improving the level of network security and preventing phishing are a matter of great concern to both the state and researchers. A 2 (automation trust tendency) *2 (system reliability level) *2 (feedback) between-subjects design was adopted to study the impact of individual characteristics and system features on phishing detection. Three hundred ninety-eight participants completed a phishing email task to identify whether 40 emails were legitimate or fraudulent. The results showed that systems with feedback and high reliability improve usersâ?? performance in email identification. Users with a high tendency towards automation trust have a higher risk of phishing. However, feedback from the system helps calibrate a high automation trust tendency.

"Ladder falls from overreaching are a problem in older adults. Evidence suggests ladder use behavior to be dependent on interfacing user and environmental circumstances (i.e. situational factors). This study investigates the effects of situational factors (remaining debris, ladder position, time into task, hand dominant reach, reaching disposition) on reaching during a gutter clearing task on a ladder in 104 older adults. Reaching was quantified as the maximum lateral center of pressure (COP) displacement from the ladder's center. A reach was classified as an overreach when the COP displaced outside the ladder width, indicative of a ladder tip. Reaching disposition, remaining debris, ladder position, and the interaction of reaching disposition and remaining debris predicted 20% of the reaching variability during the ladder task. Overreaching was observed in 40% of participants accounting for 13% of all extended reaches (beyond ladder). This work can guide interventions on mitigating overreaching and improving ladder safety.","Ladder falls, Reaching, Decision making",David D. Williams and Kurt E. Beschorner and Daina L.

"This driving simulator study aimed to encourage cooperative lane changes through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and explore whether emotional or rational communication content is better in promoting cooperative lane change. A total of 960 lane-changing datapoints from 30 participants in a driving simulation environment were collected. The participantsâ?? behavior, driving-related data, and emotional responses were recorded and analyzed. The results revealed that the trigger time to collision (TTC) between the lane changer and the following vehicle in the target lane and communication types were all important factors influencing the willingness of drivers to cooperate. V2V communication could significantly increase the willingness of the driver in the following vehicle to cooperate compared to the traditional method in which desire to change lanes is conveyed with only turn lights. The effect of different communication contents on willingness to cooperate did not vary significantly; however, emotional communication was superior to rational communication in some cases. This indicates that changing lanes owing to an emergency was more likely to be successful. The results of this study can provide a reference for V2V communication design for a safer and more comfortable driving experience.","Emotional, Rational, Communication, Cooperation, Lane change",Jingyue Zheng and Liang Ma and Wei Zhang,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000655,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103742,0003-6870,2022,103742,102,Applied Ergonomics,Promotion of cooperative lane changes by use of emotional vehicle-to-vehicle communication,article,ZHENG2022103742
"Previously, we observed no significant reductions in sitting time of the multicomponent Dynamic Work (DW) intervention among office workers. In this study we used mixed-method data to understand context, implementation (i.e. recruitment and delivery) and mechanism of impact (i.e. experiences) of the DW intervention and to explore whether an higher implementation index score led to larger changes in participantsâ?? outcomes. We found considerable variation across departments regarding context (i.e. different size and work tasks) and implementation (i.e. delivery varied). Satisfaction with the DW intervention was high. An higher implementation index score was associated with lower overall sitting time, lower occupational sitting time, higher number of steps/day and steps/day at work at 4-months, which was maintained at 8-month for occupational sitting time. These findings provide an understanding that implementation was affected by a lack of availability of intervention components, department policy, work tasks, positioning and work location.

"In this three-year study we examined the effect on work ability in a cohort of workers before and after the implementation of a workplace intervention based on the APHIRM (A Participative Hazard Identification and Risk Management) toolkit. Primary analysis was conducted to detect changes in mean work ability scores between baseline and three-year follow-up for all workers who completed the surveys (matched and unmatched), and all workers who were â?¥50 years of age (matched and unmatched). There were no significant differences between the two time periods. A secondary analysis was undertaken to examine associations between risk factors and work ability scores. This identified that six of the 18 psychosocial risk factors, and three of the eight physical risk factors associated with reduced work ability at baseline were no longer significant.

"Maritime incidents occurring during pilotage are of international concern. Maritime pilots control most pilotage operations worldwide, yet despite the safety criticality of their role, research examining pilot decision-making processes during these complex and dynamic operations is scarce. This article describes the findings from two studies that utilised an integrated systems thinking framework to understand how pilots make decisions and what factors are perceived to influence their decisions. Interviews were held with 22 pilots (Study 1) and 17 maritime safety stakeholders (Study 2) in the New Zealand maritime context. The findings illustrate the challenges pilots face during pilotage and provide insights into their decision-making processes and the systemic factors that can be addressed to improve maritime safety. Given the multiple causal pathways to incidents occurring during pilotage identified by this research, it is suggested that multiple systems-wide interventions are needed, which is likely to require a long-term, strategic approach.","Systems thinking, Decision-making, Maritime pilot, Critical decision method, AcciMap",Grant L.

"Human reliability analysis plays an important role in the safety assessment and management of rail operations. This paper discusses how the increasing availability of operational data can be used to develop an understanding of train driver reliability. The paper derives human reliability data for two driving tasks, stopping at red signals and controlling speed on approach to buffer stops. In the first of these cases, a tool has been developed that can estimate the number of times a signal is approached at red by trains on the Great Britain (GB) rail network. The tool has been developed using big data techniques and ideas, recording and analysing millions of pieces of data from live operational feeds to update and summarise statistics from thousands of signal locations in GB on a daily basis. The resulting driver reliability data are compared to similar analyses of other train driving tasks. This shows human reliability approaching the currently accepted limits of human performance. It also shows higher error rates amongst freight train drivers than passenger train drivers for these tasks. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the task specific performance limits if further improvements in human reliability are sought. It also provides a practical example of how big data could play an increasingly important role in system error management, whether from the perspective of understanding normal performance and the limits of performance for specific tasks or as the basis for dynamic safety indicators which, if not leading, could at least become closer to real time.",,Chris Harrison and Julian Stow and Xiaocheng Ge and Jonathan Gregory and Huw Gibson and Alice Monk,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001181,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103795,0003-6870,2022,103795,104,Applied Ergonomics,At the limit?

Human perception of automation reliability and automation acceptance behaviours are key to effective human-automation teaming. This study examined factors that impact perceptions of automation reliability over time and the acceptance of automated advice. Participants completed a maritime vessel classification task in which they classified vessels (contacts) with the assistance of automation. In Experiment 1 automation reliability successively switched from high to low (or vice versa). In Experiment 2 automation reliability decreased by varying magnitudes before returning to high. Participants did not initially calibrate to true reliability and experiencing low automation reliability reduced future reliability estimates when experiencing subsequent high reliability. Automation acceptance was predicted by positive differences between participant perception of automation reliability and confidence in their own manual classification reliability. Experiencing low automation reliability caused perceptions of reliability and automation acceptance rates to diverge. These findings have important implications for training and adaptive human-automation teaming in complex work environments.,"Automation reliability, Human-automation teaming, Automation reliance",Jack Hutchinson and Luke Strickland and Simon Farrell and Shayne Loft,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001582,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103835,0003-6870,2022,103835,105,Applied Ergonomics,Human behavioral response to fluctuating automation reliability,article,HUTCHINSON2022103835
"The control of rail signalling is known to be highly dependent on local knowledge and local factors. It is also known to be highly cognitive in its nature involving a constant balancing of system performance within the constraints of safety. In the current paper, data generated through field work with signallers were used to understand the role of local knowledge, set against the background of an existing Local Knowledge Framework (Pickup et al., 2013) that was proposed to help determine the contents and mechanisms behind local knowledge in rail signalling. The field work included interviews with signallers and operations managers along with observations of signaller work. The results showed that the local knowledge framework needs to be expanded to include aspects related to the general public at user worked crossings and level crossings. In addition, the analysis highlights some of the issues with the transmission of local knowledge. The paper then discusses some of the gaps in the current framework, highlighting the importance not only of local knowledge for specific functions of signalling, but how these interact to support trade-offs to balance performance with safety.

"The installation of shoulders on rural roads to create more forgiving roads encourages drivers to cut corners on right-hand bends, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Since eye movements and steering control are closely coupled, this study investigated how the presence of a shoulder influences drivers' gaze strategies. To this end, eighteen drivers negotiated right-hand bends with and without a shoulder on a simulated rural road. In the presence of a shoulder, participants modified their visual sampling of the road by directing their gaze further inside the bend. At the same time, their lane position was deviated inward throughout the bend and the vehicle spent more time out of the lane. These results suggest that the shoulder influences the visual processes involved in trajectory planning. Recommendations are made to encourage drivers to keep their eyes and vehicle in the driving lane when a shoulder is present.","Bends, Paved shoulder, Steering strategies, Visual control of steering, Driving simulator",Sami Mecheri and Franck Mars and RÃ©gis Lobjois,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001211,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103798,0003-6870,2022,103798,103,Applied Ergonomics,Gaze and steering strategies while driving around bends with shoulders,article,MECHERI2022103798
"This cross-sectional study examined the physiological effects of two active chairs (AC1: had the feature to pedal and slide forward; AC2: was a multiaxial chair) compared to a traditional office chair and standing workstation. Twenty-four healthy participants computed at each of the workstations for 60Â min. The active protocol was to alternate between a pedalling/side-to-side motion and sliding forward/front-to-back motion to the sound of a metronome operating at 40 bpm. The participants' physiological effects were recorded using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS); electrodermal activity (EDA) and a heart rate (HR) monitor for each collection period. Statistical analysis was conducted using a repeated measures analysis of variance for within-task and between-workstation comparisons. A Tukey's post hoc analysis was calculated for significant findings. Both active chairs significantly increased oxygenated blood in the gastrocnemius and participants' heart rate and EDA (stress) levels were affected slightly by task and time. However, participants felt more â??productiveâ? sitting in the control chair than in either of the active chairs.","Active chairs, Standing, Blood oxygenation, Heart rate, Electrodermal activity",Michelle C.

"Back support exosuits can support workers in physically demanding jobs by reducing muscle load, which could reduce risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This paper presents a two-session evaluation of a commercial exosuit, the Auxivo LiftSuit 1.1. In session 1, 17 participants performed single repetitions of lifting and static leaning tasks with and without the LiftSuit. In session 2, 10 participants performed 50 box lifting repetitions with and without the LiftSuit. In session 1, the exosuit was considered mildly to moderately helpful, and reduced erector spinae and middle trapezius electromyograms. In session 2, the exosuit was not considered helpful, but reduced the middle trapezius electromyogram and trunk and thigh ranges of motion. These effects are likely due to placement of elastic elements and excessive stiffness at the hips. Overall, the LiftSuit appears suboptimal for long-term use, though elastic elements on the upper back may reduce muscle activation in future exosuit designs.","Exosuits, Exoskeletons, Back support",Maja GorÅ¡iÄ and Yu Song and Boyi Dai and Vesna D.

"The present study sought to manipulate workload individually for participants to evaluate whether individual manipulations of workload produces similar subjective ratings and performance changes across participants. Participants included eight Army-rated rotary-wing aviators who presented to the laboratory for two separate visits. During the first visit, individual responses to workload were determined, and during the second visit, individually manipulated high workload flights were completed. Outcome measures included flight performance and subjective workload ratings. Data were examined at the group and individual level. Subjective ratings of workload endorsed the individual workload manipulations, while performance data provided some additional support. By taking an individualized approach such as this, researchers and practitioners may be better able to control for individual differences influencing workload. This has important implications for system design and testing, development of new intervention technologies, and assessing methods for operator monitoring.","Workload, Aviation, Design and testing",Kathryn A.

"Work-related musculoskeletal disorders have been recognized as a global problem that affects millions of people annually. Fatigue is one of the main contributors to musculoskeletal disorders. Thus, this study investigated fatigue detection based on the measured body motion by wearable inertial measurement units. We quantified the body motion during manual handling tasks using a novel kinematic score (i.e., K-score), and the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA). K-score and REBA were calculated using joint angles. Nevertheless, unlike REBA, K-score showed a significant correlation (Spearman's correlation coefficient of Ï(302)Â =Â 0.21, pÂ <Â 0.05) with electromyography (EMG) signal amplitude, which was affected by muscle fatigue. Therefore, in-field measurement of K-score using inertial measurement units could detect the fatigue-induced change of body motion in long-duration manual handling tasks. Our proposed K-score can be used to assess fatigue-related ergonomic risk in long-term and real-world working conditions without the need for tedious EMG recording at workplaces.","Electromyography, Ergonomic risk assessment, Wearable inertial measurement units",Karla {Beltran Martinez} and Milad Nazarahari and Hossein Rouhani,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000801,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103757,0003-6870,2022,103757,102,Applied Ergonomics,K-score: A novel scoring system to quantify fatigue-related ergonomic risk based on joint angle measurements via wearable inertial measurement units,article,BELTRANMARTINEZ2022103757
"With the development of connected vehicles, in-vehicle auditory alerts enable drivers to effectively avoid hazards by quickly presenting critical information in advance. Auditory icons can be understood quickly, evoking a better user experience. However, as collision warnings, the design and application of auditory icons still need further exploration. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effects of internal semantic mapping and external acoustic characteristics (compression and dynamics design) on driver performance and subjective experience. Thirty-two participants (17 females) experienced 15 types of warnings â?? (3 dynamics: mapping 0 vs. 1 vs. 2)Â Ã?Â (5 warning types: original iconic vs. original metaphorical vs. compressed iconic vs. compressed metaphorical auditory icon vs. earcon) â?? in a simulator. We found that compression design was effective for rapid risk avoidance, which was more effective in iconic and highly pitch-dynamic sounds.

"Adaptive capacity has been described as instrumental for the development of resilience in healthcare. Yet, our theoretical understanding of adaptive capacity remains relatively underdeveloped. This research therefore aims at developing a new understanding of the nature of adaptive capacity by exploring the following research questions: 1. What constitutes adaptive capacity across different healthcare contexts? and 2. What type of enabling factors support adaptive capacity across different healthcare contexts? The study used a novel combination of qualitative methods featuring a metasynthesis of narratives based on empirical research to contribute understanding of adaptive capacity across different healthcare contexts. The findings show that adaptive capacity was found to include four forms: reframing, aligning, coping, and innovating. A framework illustrating the relatedness between the identified forms, in terms of resources, change and enablers, is provided. Based on these findings, a new definition of adaptive capacity for resilience in healthcare is proposed.","Adaptive capacity, Resilience in healthcare, Quality, Reframing, Aligning, Coping, Innovating, Definition, Conceptual framework",Hilda BÃ¸ Lyng and Carl Macrae and VeslemÃ¸y Guise and Cecilie Haraldseid-Driftland and Birte Fagerdal and Lene Schibevaag and Janne Gro Alsvik and Siri Wiig,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001338,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103810,0003-6870,2022,103810,104,Applied Ergonomics,Exploring the nature of adaptive capacity for resilience in healthcare across different healthcare contexts; a metasynthesis of narratives,article,LYNG2022103810
"Excessive physical demand at work has traditionally been connected with adverse health outcomes, but excessive sitting is now also being recognised as an occupational hazard and emerging work-related risk. Traditional preventive occupational health and ergonomics programs are useful but limited through reliance on individual behaviour change and time-diversion from productive work. A new â??Goldilocks Work Paradigmâ?? aims to optimise health and productivity by using movements of productive tasks. Using rail driving as a specific case of a highly sedentary and inflexible working environment, we construct a conceptual framework for designing better jobs, arguing that a theoretical amalgamation of the new Goldilocks Work Paradigm with System Thinking, Participatory Ergonomics, and a Risk Management Framework, is needed, for establishing a unified, strategic approachâ??a â??just rightâ?? job design model. We extend this by outlining a practical process of designing better jobs with tools that can be used to achieve it.","Systems thinking, Participatory ergonomics, Occupational health, Sedentary work, Train driving",Anjum Naweed and Janine Chapman and Corneel Vandelanotte and Stephanie E.

"Computed Tomography (CT) is increasingly used in screening of cabin baggage in airports. The current study aimed to establish whether screening with CT confers a detection advantage over dual-view (DV) X-ray when resolution is controlled. We also evaluated whether a â??targetlessâ?? search strategy â?? in which screeners identify and reject safe items â?? improved detection relative to target-based methods. In an online study, 104 novice screeners were trained with either CT or DV, and either a targetless or a target-based search strategy. Screeners were then tested in a simulated cabin baggage screening task. CT screeners performed with greater sensitivity than DV screeners. Search strategy did not affect sensitivity, although the target-based strategy resulted in a more liberal criterion. We conclude that CT imaging confers a benefit to screening performance over DV when image resolution is controlled. This is likely due to the ability to rotate the image to resolve occlusions.",,Maximilian G.

"Studies examining the potential of augmented reality (AR) to improve assembly tasks are often unrepresentative of real assembly line conditions and assess mental workload only through subjective measurements and leads to conflicting results. We proposed a study directly carried out in industrial settings, to compare the impact of AR-based instructions to computerized instructions, on assembly effectiveness (completion time and errors) and mental workload using objective (eye tracking), subjective (NASA-TLX) and behavioral measurements (dual task paradigm). According to our results, AR did not improve effectiveness (increased assembly times and no decrease in assembly errors). Two out of three measurements indicated that AR led to more mental workload for simple assembly workstation, but equated computer instructions for complex workstation. Our data also suggest that, AR users were less able to detect external events (danger, alert), which may play an important role in the occurrence of work accidents.","Augmented reality, Industrial assembly, Mental workload",Mathilde Drouot and Nathalie {Le Bigot} and Emmanuel Bricard and Jean-Louis de Bougrenet and Vincent Nourrit,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001168,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103793,0003-6870,2022,103793,103,Applied Ergonomics,Augmented reality on industrial assembly line: Impact on effectiveness and mental workload,article,DROUOT2022103793
"Upright vacuum cleaners for home use have been replaced with lightweight cordless stick vacuum cleaners, specifically those with the center of mass (CoM) near the handle. The current study evaluated upper extremity muscular loads associated with household floor vacuuming with the high CoM stick vacuum cleaners. Twenty participants conducted vacuuming on tiled and carpeted floors with straight and curved back-and-forth motions using medium (2.92Â kg) and heavier weight (3.56Â kg) cordless stick vacuums. The myoelectric signals of their upper extremity muscles were quantified during vacuuming. Mean normalized activity ranged from 8.2% to 20.2% of the maximum contraction capacity, with greater activity when vacuuming carpeted floors with a heavier vacuum cleaner. Study findings indicate that floor vacuuming with a cordless stick vacuum may not be as ergonomically efficient as assumed by their lighter weight. Instead, it is a physically demanding housekeeping activity that needs ergonomic attention.","Housekeeping, Vacuum cleaner, Electromyography",Yujin Kwon and Gwanseob Shin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022001442,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103821,0003-6870,2022,103821,104,Applied Ergonomics,Upper extremity muscle activity when vacuuming floors with cordless stick vacuum cleaners,article,KWON2022103821
"Purpose Three feasible cooling methods for treatment of hyperthermic individuals in the military, that differed considerably in water volume needed (none to ~80 L), were evaluated. Methods Ten male soldiers were cooled following exercise-induced hyperthermia (rectal temperature (Tre) â?¼39.5Â Â°C) using ventilation by fanning (1.7Â mÂ sâ??1), ventilation by fanning (1.7Â mÂ sâ??1) while wearing a wet t-shirt (250Â mLâ??27Â Â°C water) and tarp assisted cooling with oscillations (80Â L of 27.2Â Â±Â 0.5Â Â°C water; TACO). Results Cooling rates were higher using TACO (0.116Â Â±Â 0.032Â Â°C minâ??1) compared to ventilation (0.065Â Â±Â 0.011Â Â°C minâ??1, P<0.001) and ventilation in combination with a wet t-shirt (0.074Â Â±Â 0.020Â Â°C minâ??1, P=0.002). Time to cool (TTC) to Tre=38.2 Â°C for TACO was shorter (14Â Â±Â 4Â min) compared to ventilation only (20Â Â±Â 5Â min; P=0.018), but not to ventilation while wearing a wet t-shirt (18Â Â±Â 6Â min; P=0.090). Conclusions TACO may be an acceptable, efficient and feasible cooling method in case of exertional heat stroke.

"Reaction forces from nutrunner tools constitute a risk of developing MSDs. However, recommendations for sustainable reaction force levels are lacking. The aim of this study was to inform recommendations regarding reaction load exposures from right-angle nutrunners. Through a psychophysics approach, experienced assembly workers subjectively assessed reaction loads when using a nutrunner in six combinations of tool tightening strategy, work-pace and screw-joint stiffness. Electromyography, tool and joint parameters were measured. Regardless of tightening strategy, joint stiffness and work-pace combinations, no large differences in acceptable tightening torque, peak reaction force, and handle displacement were observed. However, acceptable jerk and impulse differed substantially between the TurboTightÂ® (high-acceleration) and QuickStepÂ® (conventional) tightening strategies. Although the TurboTightÂ® strategy overall showed reduced peak muscular activities compared to the QuickStepÂ®, the participant-rated acceptable torque levels were similar, plausibly due to TurboTightsâ?? high jerk levels. Jerk and impulse are hypothesized to influence the perception of reaction loads.","Assembly work, Power tools, Electromyography, Ergonomics assessment",A. Mazaheri and M. Forsman and R.

"Presented is a framework that uses pattern classification methods to incrementally morph whole-body movement patterns to investigate how personal (sex, military experience, and body mass) and load characteristics affect the survivability tradespace: performance, musculoskeletal health, and susceptibility to enemy action. Sixteen civilians and 12 soldiers performed eight military-based movement patterns under three body-borne loads: â?¼5.5Â kg, â?¼22Â kg, and â?¼38Â kg. Our framework reduces dimensionality using principal component analysis and uses linear discriminant analysis to classify groups and morph movement patterns. Our framework produces morphed whole-body movement patterns that emulate previously published changes to the survivability tradespace caused by body-borne loads. Additionally, we identified that personal characteristics can greatly impact the tradespace when carrying heavy body-borne loads. Using our framework, military leaders can make decisions based on objective information for armour procurement, employment of armour, and battlefield performance, which can positively impact operational readiness and increase overall mission success.","Military, Pattern classification, Principal component analysis",Matthew P.

"In electric buses, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system is responsible for up to 50% of the energy consumption, thereby significantly affecting the efficiency. It is therefore necessary to identify improved thermal settings for the bus cabin to minimize the energy consumption, while guaranteeing good thermal comfort. To achieve this goal, this paper presents the results of climatic measurements in an electric bus in Berlin, Germany. These measurements were performed for outer temperatures between 5.3Â Â°C and 7.8Â Â°C and four cabin temperature settings. During the measurements, several climatic parameters and the energy consumption were measured, whereas the thermal comfort (TC) was evaluated via 71 passengersâ?? surveys. The results show that the climatic conditions in the bus vary greatly depending on the position (up to 3Â K difference in mean air temperature) and height (up to 8Â K/m temperature-to-height ratio). Additionally, the surveys show that the mean value of the thermal comfort parameter TC is minimized to a value of 0.15 (corresponding to â??comfortableâ? thermal perception) for a set temperature of 21Â Â°C, whereas the thermal conditions are perceived as acceptable even with heating off.","Electric buses, HVAC system, Thermal comfort, Energy efficiency",Francesco Cigarini and Peer Schminkel and Michael Sonnekalb and Pascal Best and Dietmar GÃ¶hlich,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702200179X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103856,0003-6870,2022,103856,105,Applied Ergonomics,Determination of improved climatic conditions for thermal comfort and energy efficiency in electric buses,article,CIGARINI2022103856

"3D gestural technology for HCI could transform the way people interact with computing systems. There are traditionally two approaches to developing gestural technology systems: a human-based approach where usability is maximized and a technology-based approach where system accuracy is maximized. The tradeoff between usability and accuracy may negatively affect the overall trust and reliability in the system. Therefore, this study seeks to redefine the human-based approach to gestural system development by introducing a bottom-up approach to identifying the lower-level features that produce a gesture, thus allowing the technology to accurately recognize features. A user elicitation study was performed, and gestures were classified according to a novel feature extraction gesture taxonomy and a traditional taxonomy of classifying gestures as a unit. The feature-extraction approach revealed several advantages because it fosters a bottom-up approach to identifying gesture features. Using this approach may mitigate the effects of the usability-accuracy tradeoff in gestural system development.","3D gestural systems, Human-computer interaction, Computer system development",Katherina A.

Participants (nÂ =Â 17) completed the task in their own shoes (Pre-Exoskeleton and Post-Exoskeleton trials), and when wearing a lower-limb exoskeleton (Dephy ExoBoot) in both powered and unpowered states. Data were collected via inertial measurement units (on the torso and feet) and analyzed on a pooled level (with data from all participants) and on an individual level (participant-specific confidence intervals). When examining pooled data, it was observed that the exoskeleton had mixed effects on stride stability metrics. When compared to the Post-Exoskeleton shoe control, it was observed that stride duration was increased when wearing the exoskeleton (both powered and unpowered states), while normalized stride length and stride speed were not affected. Despite the changes in stride stability, overall balance (as measured by torso sway) remained unaffected by exoskeleton state. On an individual level, it was observed that not all participants followed these general trends, and within each metric, some increased, some decreased, and some had no change in the Powered Exoskeleton condition when compared to the Post-Exoskeleton Shoe condition: normalized stride length (0% increased, 12% decreased, 88% no change), stride duration (35% increased, 0% decreased, 65% no change), and torso sway (0% increased, 12% decreased, 88% no change). Our findings suggest that the lower-limb exoskeleton evaluated can be used during tasks that require balancing, and we recommend that balancing tasks be included in standards for exoskeleton evaluation.","IMU, Wearable sensor, Standards development, Walking, Gait characteristics",Sarah Gonzalez and Paul Stegall and Stephen M.

"Although the objective assessment of mental workload has been a focus of human factors research, few studies have investigated stakeholders' attitudes towards its implementation in real workplaces. The present study addresses this research gap by surveying NÂ =Â 702 managers in three European countries (Germany, United Kingdom, Spain) about their expectations and concerns regarding sensor-based monitoring of employee mental workload. The data confirm the relevance of expectations regarding improvements of workplace design and employee well-being, as well as concerns about restrictions of employees' privacy and sovereignty, for the implementation of workload monitoring. Furthermore, Bayesian regression models show that the examined expectations have a substantial positive association with managersâ?? willingness to support workload monitoring in their company. Privacy concerns are identified as a significant barrier to the acceptance of workload monitoring, both in terms of their prevalence among managers and their strong negative relationship with monitoring support.","Mental workload, Monitoring, Privacy concerns",Sebastian PÃ¼tz and Vera Rick and Alexander Mertens and Verena Nitsch,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702200062X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103739,0003-6870,2022,103739,102,Applied Ergonomics,Using IoT devices for sensor-based monitoring of employees' mental workload: Investigating managersâ?? expectations and concerns,article,PUTZ2022103739
"Background and aims Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries among gastroenterologists are common. Our study describes risk factors and consequences of injury by comparing provider-specific anthropometric and objective procedural data to self-reported injury patterns. Methods A validated MSK symptom survey was sent to gastroenterologists to gauge prevalence, distribution, and severity of active injury. Respondentsâ?? procedural activities over 7 years were collected via an endoscopic database. Results 64 surveys were completed. 54 respondents had active pain; 53.1% reported activity-limiting injury. Activity-limiting injuries lead to longer colonoscopy times (25.3 vs. 22.1Â min, PÂ =Â 0.03) and lower procedural volumes (532 vs. 807, PÂ =Â 0.01). Hand/wrist injuries yielded longer colonoscopy insertion times (9.35 vs. 8.21Â min, PÂ =Â 0.03) and less hands-on scope hours (81.2 vs. 111.7Â h, PÂ =Â 0.04). Higher esophagogastroduodenoscopy volume corelated with shoulder injury (336.5 vs. 243.1 EGDs/year, PÂ =Â 0.04). Females had more foot injuries (PÂ =Â 0.04). Conclusion Activity-limiting MSK symptoms/injuries affect over 50% of endoscopists with negative impact on procedural volume and efficiency.","Endoscopy, Colonoscopy, Ergonomics, Injury, Disability, Musculoskeletal, Pain, Occupational injury",Alexander T.

"This study explored the possibility of applying personalized takeover requests (TORs) in an automated driving system (ADS), which required drivers to regain control when the system reached its limits. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to investigate how speech-based TOR voices impacted driver performance in takeover scenarios with two lead time conditions in conditionally automated driving (level 3). Eighteen participants drove in three sessions, with each session having a different TOR voice (a synthesized male voice, a synthesized female voice, and a significant other voice). Two scenarios with a lead time of 5Â s and two scenarios with a lead time of 12Â s were provided per session. The driver takeover time and quality data were collected. A follow-up interview was conducted to gain a clearer understanding of the driversâ?? psychological feelings about each TOR voice during takeovers. Changes in takeover time and takeover quality caused by TOR voices were similar in both lead time conditions, except for the lateral acceleration. The synthesized male voice led to a larger maximum lateral acceleration than the other two voices in the 5Â s condition. Interestingly, most drivers preferred choosing the synthesized female voice for future takeovers and showed negative attitudes toward the significant other voice. Our results implied that choosing TOR voices should consider the driversâ?? daily voice-usage habits as well as specific context of use, and personalized TOR voices should be incorporated into the ADS prudently.","Conditionally automated driving, Speech-based takeover requests, Personalized voices, Takeover performance",Yi Wang and Wei Zhang and Ronggang Zhou,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000187,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103695,0003-6870,2022,103695,101,Applied Ergonomics,Speech-based takeover requests in conditionally automated driving: Effects of different voices on the driver takeover performance,article,WANG2022103695
"Development of adaptive aids to support human performance in complex systems is a cornerstone of human factors. Research in this area has led to a diversity of ideas regarding potential activation methods. However, little guidance has been provided on how to select among aid activation methods, and this lack of guidance could hinder adaptive aid development and deployment. Within the current paper, we review available methods of aid activation and describe a process for developing and validating adaptive aiding systems. We focus on supporting system designers who wish to select the ideal aid activation method for an intended application. The process that we recommend is an empirical approach to evaluate the feasibility, costs, and benefits of various potential methods of aid activation. This methodological framework will support practitioners making critical decisions about the design of aiding systems.","Adaptive aiding, System design, Human performance",Eric T.

"With the rapid rise in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for military and civil first-person applications like infrastructure inspection, there is an increased need for skilled UAV operators. However, research on effective training of UAV pilots has not kept pace with the demand. How much autonomy should be onboard, how much training, and how much control humans should have are still points of debate. To help fill this gap, this paper examines how different training programs and levels of control autonomy affect training outcomes for people operating a UAV in inspection tasks with high onboard autonomy. Results revealed a cost-benefit trade space in that those top performers with both lower-level teleoperation and higher-level supervisory control training could achieve the best performance, but with higher variability, as compare to those who received just supervisory control training. Another important finding was that those trainees who were overconfident were more likely to spend too much time micro-controlling the UAV, and also 15 times more likely to crash. Given that commercial UAV licensing is expected to significantly increase in the next few years, these results suggest more work is needed to determine how to mitigate overconfidence bias both through training and design.","Supervisory control, Drone, UAV, Pilot training",Songpo Li and Mary L.

"Overhead work is an important risk factor associated with musculoskeletal disorders of the neck and shoulder region. This study aimed to propose and evaluate a passive head/neck supporting exoskeleton (HNSE) as a potential ergonomic intervention for overhead work applications. Fourteen male participants were asked to perform a simulated overhead task of fastening/unfastening nut in 4 randomized sessions, characterized by two variables: neck extension angle (40% and 80% of neck maximum range of motion) and exoskeleton condition (wearing and not wearing the HNSE). Using the HNSE, significantly alleviated perceived discomfort in the neck (p-valueÂ =Â 0.009), right shoulder (p-valueÂ =Â 0.05) and left shoulder (p-valueÂ =Â 0.02) and reduced electromyographic activity of the right (p-valueÂ =Â 0.005) and left (p-valueÂ =Â 0.01) sternocleidomastoid muscles. However, utilizing the exoskeleton caused a remarkable increase in right (p-valueÂ =Â 0.04) and left (p-valueÂ =Â 0.05) trapezius electromyographic activities. Performance was not significantly affected by the HNSE. Although the HNSE had promising effects with respect to discomfort and muscular activity in the static overhead task, future work is still needed to investigate its effect on performance and to provide support for the generalizability of study results.","Exoskeletons, Overhead work, Ergonomic design, Musculoskeletal disorders",Ehsan Garosi and Adel Mazloumi and Amir Homayoun Jafari and Ahmadreza Keihani and Mansour Shamsipour and Ramin Kordi and Zeinab Kazemi,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000229,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103699,0003-6870,2022,103699,101,Applied Ergonomics,Design and ergonomic assessment of a passive head/neck supporting exoskeleton for overhead work use,article,GAROSI2022103699
"Complaints of musculoskeletal pain are common among employees who stand for prolonged periods. This study sought to determine if an anti-fatigue mat (AFM) could uniquely affect low back pain (LBP), low back posture, and foot-floor interface responses in individuals prone to developing LBP (termed pain developers (PDs)) during prolonged standing experiments compared to those who do not develop LBP under the same exposures (termed non pain developers (NPDs)). Sixteen volunteers (8 PDs and 8 NPDs) were recruited based on their pain-development tendencies, which were established in previous standing experiments. They visited the laboratory on two separate days for 60Â min of light manual work while standing on either a rigid floor or AFM. All participants were asymptomatic at the beginning of each experimental session. The amount of LBP experienced during the standing exposure, measured via a visual analogue scale, was reduced (pÂ =Â 0.03) in the PD group when on the AFM (3.6Â Â±Â 6Â mm) compared to the rigid floor (6.8Â Â±Â 7Â mm). LBP levels remained low and unchanged (pÂ =Â 0.5) between the AFM (2.4Â Â±Â 5Â mm) and rigid floor (1.6Â Â±Â 2Â mm) conditions for the NPD group. Neither postural nor foot-floor interface measures correlated with this unique reduction of LBP for the PD group when standing on the AFM. The AFM did, however, increase centre of pressure excursion (NPD 55% increase; PD 35% increase) and tended to increase the number of body weight shifts (NPD 116% increase; PD 54% increase) in both the PD and NPD groups. These findings suggest that AFMs may selectively benefit individuals prone to developing standing-induced back pain by facilitating subtle movements at the foot-floor interface.","Anti-fatigue mats, Low back pain, Prolonged standing",Taylor B.

"Inhibitory control, the ability to inhibit impulsive responses and irrelevant stimuli, enables high level functioning and activities of daily living. The Simon task probes inhibition using interfering stimuli, i.e., cues spatially presented on the opposite side of the indicated response; incongruent response times (RT) are slower than congruent RTs. Operational applicability of the Simon task beyond finger/hand manipulations and visual/auditory cues is unclear, but important to consider as new technologies provide tactile cues and require motor responses from the lower extremity (e.g., exoskeletons). In this study, twenty participants completed the Simon task under four conditions, each combination of two cue (visual/tactile) and response (upper/lower-extremity) modalities. RT were significantly longer for incongruent than congruent cues across cue-response pairs. However, alternative cue-response pairs yielded slower RT and decreased accuracy for tactile cues and lower-extremity responses. Results support operational usage of the Simon task to probe inhibition using tactile cues and lower-extremity responses relevant for new technologies like exoskeletons and immersive environments.","Information processing, Tactile/haptic displays, Perception-action",Aditi Gupta and Harvey M. {Edwards III} and Aaron R.

"As COVID-19 spread across Brazil, it quickly reached remote regions including Amazon's ultra-peripheral locations where patient transportation through rivers is added to the list of obstacles to overcome. This article analyses the pandemic's effects in the access of riverine communities to the prehospital emergency healthcare system in the Brazilian Upper Amazon River region. To do so, we present two studies that by using a Resilience Engineering approach aimed to predict the functioning of the Brazilian Mobile Emergency Medical Service (SAMU) for riverside and coastal areas during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the normal system functioning. Study I, carried out before the pandemic, applied ethnographic methods for data collection and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method - FRAM for data analysis in order to develop a model of the mobile emergency care in the region during typical conditions of operation. Study II then estimated how changes in variability dynamics would alter system functioning during the pandemic, arriving at three trends that could lead the service to collapse. Finally, the accuracy of predictions is discussed after the pandemic first peaked in the region. Findings reveal that relatively small changes in variability dynamics can deliver strong implications to operating care and safety of expeditions aboard water ambulances. Also, important elements that add to the resilient capabilities of the system are extra-organizational, and thus during the pandemic safety became jeopardized as informal support networks grew fragile. Using FRAM for modelling regular operation enabled prospective scenario analysis that accurately predicted disruptions in providing emergency care to riverine population.","FRAM, Mobile emergency care, Risk assessment, Resilience engineering, Safety management",Rodrigo Arcuri and Hugo Cesar Bellas and Denise de Souza Ferreira and BÃ¡rbara BulhÃµes and Mario Cesar RodrÃ­guez Vidal and Paulo Victor Rodrigues de Carvalho and Alessandro JatobÃ¡ and Erik Hollnagel,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002799,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103632,0003-6870,2022,103632,99,Applied Ergonomics,On the brink of disruption: Applying Resilience Engineering to anticipate system performance under crisis,article,ARCURI2022103632
"Background Failure to rescue (FTR) denotes mortality from post-operative complications after surgery with curative intent. High-volume, low-mortality units have similar complication rates to others, but have lower FTR rates. Effective response to the deteriorating post-operative patient is therefore critical to reducing surgical mortality. Resilience Engineering might afford a useful perspective for studying how the management of deterioration usually succeeds and how resilience can be strengthened. Methods We studied the response to the deteriorating patient following emergency abdominal surgery in a large surgical emergency unit, using the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). FRAM focuses on the conflicts and trade-offs inherent in the process of response, and how staff adapt to them, rather than on identifying and eliminating error. 31 semi-structured interviews and two workshops were used to construct a model of the response system from which conclusions could be drawn about possible ways to strengthen system resilience. Results The model identified 23 functions, grouped into five clusters, and their respective variability. The FRAM analysis highlighted trade-offs and conflicts which affected decisions over timing, as well as strategies used by staff to cope with these underlying tensions. Suggestions for improving system resilience centred on improving team communication, organisational learning and relationships, rather than identifying and fixing specific system faults. Conclusion FRAM can be used for analysing surgical work systems in order to identify recommendations focused on strengthening organisational resilience. Its potential value should be explored by empirical evaluation of its use in systems improvement.","Failure to rescue, Emergency surgery, Patient safety, FRAM, Resilience engineering",M. Sujan and N.

"This study aims to quantify the stresses of sonographers using two different ultrasound devices, one of conventional and one of ergonomic design. A total of 20 obstetricians and gynecologists participated in this study, and two types of tasks (scanning and positioning) were evaluated while using the two different devices. To quantify workload, four dependent variables (muscle activity, estimated grip force, subjective comfort rating, and task time) were measured. The muscular activity required while using the conventional device was 14.4% MVC (Maximum voluntary contraction) for the scanning task, which was significantly higher than that of the ergonomic device. The subjective comfort rating for the conventional design was lower than that of the ergonomic design. For the positioning task, the ergonomic device (33.2% MVC) resulted in significantly higher muscle activity in the extensor digitorum (ED) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) than the conventional design (22.2% MVC), whereas the deltoid muscle showed significantly lower activity than in users of conventional design (4.5% MVC). Ergonomically-designed ultrasound devices improve ease of moving and the probe's supporters, reduce physical load and increase ease of use for sonographers.

"Research into road safety has evolved from individual level component analysis to a much broader, systemic approach that acknowledges the fusion of â??socioâ?? and â??technicalâ?? system elements. Over the past four decades, Professor Neville Stanton has contributed to over 179 journal articles, book chapters and conference papers in the field of road safety. The journey from â??thinking humansâ?? to â??systems thinkingâ?? is demonstrated in this paper through the novel application of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to the categorisation of research activities. A systematic review of Neville's contributions to the field of road safety demonstrates that over the years, his research activities have evolved from investigating single technological or human performance aspects in isolation (e.g., in-vehicle information design and workload) through to the holistic analysis of much broader systems (e.g., investigating road safety as a whole). Importantly, this evolution goes hand in hand with a change in the focus and emphasis of recommendations for improvements to safety.

"Head Mounted Display (HMD) based Augmented Reality (AR) is being increasingly used in manufacturing and maintenance. However, limited research has been done to understand user interaction with AR interfaces, which may lead to poor usability, risk of occupational hazards, and low acceptance of AR systems. This paper uses a theoretically-driven approach to interaction design to investigate the impact of different AR modalities in terms of information mode (i.e. video vs. 3D animation) and interaction modality (i.e. hand-gesture vs. voice command) on user performance, workload, eye gaze behaviours, and usability during a maintenance assembly task. The results show that different information modes have distinct impacts compared to paper-based maintenance, in particular, 3D animation led to a 14% improvement over the video instructions in task completion time. Moreover, insights from eye gaze behaviours such as number of fixations and transition between Areas of Interest (AOIs) revealed the differences in attention switching and task comprehension difficulty with the choice of AR modalities. While, subjective user perceptions highlight some ergonomic issues such as misguidance and overreliance, which must be considered and addressed from the joint cognitive systemsâ??

"In order to manage the performance of socio-technical systems in a safe and sustainable way, the importance of looking at human and organisational factors (HOF) and their contribution to adverse events is widely recognised. In reality, however, the scope of accident and incident investigations stays usually limited to investigating the immediate causes and decision-making processes related to the accident sequence (e.g. Antonsen, 2009). Important factors, including design and planning decisions, contributing to accidents are hereby often overlooked and the weaknesses in the Safety Management System are hardly ever analysed. The SAfety FRactal ANalysis (SAFRAN) method (Accou and Reniers, 2019) can guide investigators in an intuitive and logic way, to ask questions that help to gain deeper understanding of the capability of organisations to monitor and manage safety critical variability. The essence of using the SAFRAN method for evaluating the performance of the different processes in a socio-technical system, is to approach them in a similar way, building on the generic elements that compose a SMS and systematically looking at the HOF that influenced actions and decision making, regardless of the hierarchical level they are situated at. This paper presents the SAFRAN method, specifying its HOF taxonomy and sharing examples of supporting HOF questions. The approach enables non-experts in HOF to systematically identify the different elements that introduce critical variability in performance and to recognise what additional expertise can be called upon when needed.","Human and organizational factors, Safety management systems, Accident investigation",Bart Accou and Fabrice Carpinelli,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021003094,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103662,0003-6870,2022,103662,100,Applied Ergonomics,Systematically investigating human and organisational factors in complex socio-technical systems by using the â??SAfety FRactal ANalysisâ? method,article,ACCOU2022103662
"Purpose To investigate the effect of sex and load carriage on cardiorespiratory responses to high intensity exercise in male and female soldiers. Methods Soldiers (9 women, 9 men) performed a graded treadmill test until exhaustion with no load (NL) and combat-gear with body armor (CG). Cohen's d effect sizes, paired t-tests and ANOVA were used to study differences between conditions. A mixed linear regression model analyzed the relationship between heart rate (HR) and oxygen uptake (VÌ?O2) with load and between sexes. Results Wearing CG resulted in, for both sexes, a decreased time to exhaustion (â??11Â min), lower VÌ?O2peak (L/min) ESÂ =Â 0.56; VO2peak (mL//kg/min) ESÂ =Â 2.44, both pÂ <Â 0.001, a net decrease in minute ventilation (ESÂ =Â 3.53) and no change in HRmax. No sex-difference were present except for absolute VÌ?O2peak. The VO2 and HR relationship showed a cardiorespiratory reduction wearing CG vs. NL. Added load was equal between sexes, although female soldiers' CG relative to body mass was higher (25%) than male soldiersâ?? (20%), pÂ <Â 0.01. Conclusion Wearing CG reduces soldiersâ?? cardiorespiratory capacity and exercise performance level, although the reduction cannot be explained solely based on the added load of CG, instead CG seems to restrict the capacity to fully ventilate.

"The number of older adults unable to transfer or ambulate independently is increasing. High support chairs enable people experiencing loss of mobility to be mobile, but current chair designs are associated with global functional loss and pressure ulcers. This pilot study compared the functionality of a traditional design high support chair to a new design of motorised high support chair: 1) a motion laboratory study compared joint angles and pressure at the hip, knee, ankle, elbow and spine when pushing each chair, and 2) a pressure mapping study compared the interface pressure when older people with limited mobility used the chairs. Significant reduction in joint angles for the person pushing the chair (degree difference range â??3.6 to 14.2) and decreased seated pressure (w/kg difference range â??0.2 to 2.1) for the seated user were identified for the motorised chair. Longitudinal investigations are required to determine if the significant differences identified in this pilot study result in less manual handling injuries and pressure areas.","Gait analysis, Aged, Pressure mapping, Occupational injuries, Moving and lifting patients",Stephanie Champion and Christopher Barr and Belinda Lange and Lucy K.

"This study investigated symptoms of cybersickness and postural instability experienced by new users of head-mounted display virtual reality (HMD-VR), playing VR videogames over long and repeated sessions, and moderation of these symptoms by previous videogame experience and intensity of videogame stimulus. Cybersickness (SSQ) and postural stability (anterior-posterior path-velocity) of new users of VR (nÂ =Â 80) was collected PRE-VR, POST-VR and 10Â min after completing (POST-RECOVERY) a VR gaming experience. Users comprised of videogamers (nÂ =Â 40) and non-videogamers (nÂ =Â 40), who were randomly assigned to play either action (high-intensity stimuli) or adventure (low-intensity stimuli) games in VR for 30Â min and repeated twice, one week apart. All participants, irrespective of gaming status and genre of game, experienced significant cybersickness after 30Â min in VR using current-generation HMD-VR technology, and did not adapt (POST-VR) after two sessions. However videogamers were able to recover (POST-RECOVERY) from cybersickness induced in VR significantly better than non-videogamers. All participants experienced significantly better postural stability after 30Â min in VR, irrespective of gaming experience or genre of game. Developers should create VR experiences that minimise negative symptoms of cybersickness and postural instability experience by new users of VR.","Cybersickness, Postural stability, Virtual reality, Videogames, Gamers",Adriano {da Silva Marinho} and Uwe Terton and Christian M.

"User Interface (UI) design practices often abide by popular usability heuristics such as Nielsenâ??s (1994) â??10 usability heuristics for user interface designâ? or Gerhardtâ??Powals' (1996) cognitive engineering principles. To examine the underlying mechanism of user performance enhancement by following some of these usability heuristics, we compared user performance between two device conditions: one representing design practices following two selected sets of usability heuristics (experimental condition) and the other without following them (control condition). As a research framework, we adopted the psychologicalâ??refractoryâ??period (PRP) paradigm along with the locusâ??ofâ??slack logic, a wellâ??established dualâ??task paradigm for examining the nature of cognitive benefits caused by experimental manipulations. Results showed that the experimentalâ??device condition that followed the usability heuristics yielded faster performance than the control condition, especially when the stimulusâ??onsetâ??asynchrony between the two tasks was long than when it was short. According to the locusâ??ofâ??slack logic, these results suggest that the nature of cognitive benefits caused by following the usability heuristics is more likely to be due to shortening of the responseâ??activation stage (rather than the responseâ??selection stage). These findings suggest that following the two usability heuristics tends to facilitate a specific stage of the information processes more than other stages.","Usability heuristics, Interface design, Userâ??interface (UI) design, Psychologicalâ??refractoryâ??period paradigm, Locusâ??ofâ??slack logic",Kyung Hun Jung and Jack T.

"When more than one audible alarm is heard simultaneously, discrimination may be compromised. This experiment compares near-simultaneous clinical alarms in two styles, the first are the tonal â??melodiesâ?? from the 2012/2006 version of a global medical device safety standard (IEC 60601-1-8) and the second are the auditory-icon-style recommended in the 2020 version of the same standard. Sixty-six participants were required to identify the meaning and priority of four different clinical alarms for one of the two styles of alarm (between-subjects). Alarms sounded both singly and in pairs (within-subjects). Results showed that the auditory icon alarms outperformed the tonal alarms on all measures except one, both for overall accuracy (recognizing both priority and function) and for partial accuracy (recognizing priority or function but not both). The results add to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of auditory icon alarms in clinical environments.","Clinical alarms, Audible alarms, Alarm design, Auditory cognition, Auditory perception, Auditory alarms",Judy Reed Edworthy and Cassie J.

"This study investigated the pressures occurring within the arm human-machine-interfaces (HMI) of four different exoskeletons that support static and dynamic work at or above head level, and the effects of the HMI on neurovascular supply of the upper extremity using an orthopedic provocation maneuver with raised arms with and without the exoskeletons. Decreased time in the provocation maneuver with exoskeletons indicated a negative effect of the HMIs on the vascular and neural supply of the arm. Average pressure in the static situation was 3.2Â Â±Â 0.7Â kPa and 4.4Â Â±Â 0.4Â kPa with regular peak values of 6.5Â Â±Â 0.5Â kPa in the dynamic task. These pressures were significantly higher than the pressure values that guarantee adequate tissue oxygenation. It remains unknown whether the way exoskeletons apply pressure affects vascular and neural supply to the arms, or whether the regular unloading during dynamic activity has a neutralizing effect.","Physical human-machine-interface, Circumferential compression, Overhead work, Upper arm",Christine Linnenberg and Robert Weidner,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000291,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103706,0003-6870,2022,103706,101,Applied Ergonomics,Industrial exoskeletons for overhead work: Circumferential pressures on the upper arm caused by the physical human-machine-interface,article,LINNENBERG2022103706
"Advances in human performance have shifted research attention from individuals towards understanding the effects that equipment can have on their performance. In esports, the effect of gaming peripherals on performance has only recently been explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of computer mouse mass on gaming skill. 72 video game players performed a target acquisition task, a pertinent composite skill in first-person shooter (FPS) video games, while using computer mice that varied only by their mass (50g, 60g, 90g & 100g). Results showed that participants were 4% faster and 9% more accurate with 50g, 60g, and 90g mice compared to the 100g mouse. They were also 34% more accurate and 14% more precise when using lower control-display gain and preferred lighter mice (50g and 60g) when performing the skill at a lower control-display gain. Taken together, using a lighter mouse at lower sensitivity may augment target acquisition performance among video gamers.","Esports, Performance, Human-computer interaction",Eoin Conroy and Adam J.

"A â??compressedâ?? shift schedule (substitution of a rest day by a shift, shortening the duration of work breaks) was introduced for a better fit with aircraft traffic load. Thereafter, the company asked for a survey assessing the effects of the compressed shift system. Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) completed retrospectively a specific questionnaire assessing the effects of shift schedule (modified vs. initial) and of traffic load on fatigue, alertness (on-shift, upon awakening, during daily non-work activities), and sleep (duration, satisfaction). Work organization had marginal and unexpected effects, which might indicate ATCOs' disapproval of the intervention. Traffic load affected sleep satisfaction and alertness during work and non-work activities. Specific effects of shift included reduced sleep time prior to morning shifts compared to night shifts, whereas alertness and fatigue were rated at comparable levels for both shifts. Results suggest that shiftwork features which favor sleep loss across a work cycle have deleterious consequences on alertness and increase the need for recovery, which are further enhanced by traffic load.","Air traffic control, Shift work organization, Traffic load",Claudine MÃ©lan and Nadine Cascino,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702100243X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103596,0003-6870,2022,103596,98,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of a modified shift work organization and traffic load on air traffic controllersâ?? sleep and alertness during work and non-work activities,article,MELAN2022103596
"During a driving task, the seat-driver interface is particularly influenced by the external environment and seat features. This study compares the effect of two different seats (S1 â?? soft & S2 â?? firm) and the effect of visual simulation of different road types (city, highway, mountain, country), on pressure distribution and perceived discomfort during prolonged driving. Twenty participants drove two 3-h sessions (one per seat) on a static simulator. Contact Pressure (CP), Contact Surface (CS), and Seat Pressure Distribution Percentage (SPD%) were analyzed throughout, using two pressure mats positioned on seat cushion and backrest. Whole-body and local discomfort for each body part were rated every 20Â min. The softer seat, S1, induced a greater contact surface on cushion and backrest and a lower SPD%, reflecting better pressure distribution. Pressure profiles were asymmetrical for both S1 and S2, with higher CP under left buttock (LBu) and right lower back (RLb) and greater CS under thighs and RLb. Pressure distribution was less homogeneous on mountain and city roads than on monotonous roads (highway and country). Despite the pressure differences between the seats, however, both led to similar increases in perceived whole-body discomfort throughout the driving session. Moreover, the highest discomfort scores were in the neck and the lower back areas, whatever the seat. These findings on pressure variables may have implications for the design of backrests and cushions to ensure more homogeneous pressure distribution, even though this is not shown to minimize perceived driver discomfort.","Prolonged driving, Discomfort, Seat design, Interface pressure",Pascaline Lantoine and Mathieu Lecocq and ClÃ©ment Bougard and Erick Dousset and Tanguy Marqueste and Christophe Bourdin and Jean-Marc AllÃ¨gre and Laurent Bauvineau and Serge Mesure,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021003136,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103666,0003-6870,2022,103666,100,Applied Ergonomics,Influence of car seat firmness on seat pressure profiles and perceived discomfort during prolonged simulated driving,article,LANTOINE2022103666

"Human beings play an important role in a smart manufacturing economy. The repetitive and cognitive demanding task operations of smart manufacturing require the development of system models for measuring and predicting human performance, including oil refinery monitoring tasks. The main objective of this research was to validate the generalizability of a mathematical model for the prediction of refinery operators' detection of abnormal events. Moreover, we examined operators' visual behaviors in response to abnormal situations at different ages and with different task loads, task complexities, and input devices. We found that participants had lower mean fixation durations, total fixation numbers, and fixation/saccade ratios when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Moreover, we found that older adults had higher mean saccade durations and saccade amplitudes when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Finally, the statistical model borrowed from our prior paper was found to be generalizable to different task loads and age groups for the prediction of operatorsâ?? detection of abnormal events. Our results showed that visual behaviors can indicate specific internal states of participants, including their cognitive workload, attention, and situation awareness in a real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using visual behavior to predict responsiveness of oil refinery operators and for future applications of smart manufacturing monitoring systems.","Statistical modeling prediction, Interactive devices, Control room, Eye-tracking",Chao Shi and Ling Rothrock,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000205,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103697,0003-6870,2022,103697,101,Applied Ergonomics,Validating an abnormal situation prediction model for smart manufacturing in the oil refining industry,article,SHI2022103697
"Although sitting on a stability ball has become an alternative to using an office chair, little is known about the increased potential for a fall on the deformable seat. This study examined differences in stability between sitting on a seat pan of a backless office chair and a stability ball during reaching tasks. Sixteen participants performed forward and lateral reaching tasks on a backless and armless office chair and stability ball while whole-body motion and force data under the seat were recorded. Even with participants placing their feet 16.5Â cm wider when seated on the ball, the perceived fall risk was significantly greater. Centre of pressure displacement tended to be smaller under the ball for lateral reach directions, but larger during far anterior reaches. While not statistically significant, the medial-lateral margin of stability was on average 3.4Â cm smaller on the ball. Despite attempts to increase stability by widening their stance, stability ball fall risk remained higher.","Exercise ball, Swiss ball, Seated balance",Jessa M.

"Because of the operation distractions created by large in-vehicle touch screens, it is necessary to explore the influence of the locations at which clicking and sliding gestures are performed on driving safety and operation performance. This study conducted two experiments to identify an easy operation area. In experiment 1, the influence of control size and control position on click offsets was discussed. The results showed that click offsets increased with increasing control size. Click offsets were larger at positions blocked by a driver's arm and that were far away from drivers. The click accuracy equation was fitted for different hot zone sizes. Experiment 2 focused on identifying easy sliding ranges. The results revealed sliding areas for 20%, 50%, and 80% of users under different sliding directions and positions.

"Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) can enhance road safety by sending warning signals to drivers. Multimodal signals are gaining attention in ADAS warning design because they offer redundant information that facilitates humanâ??system communication. However, no consensus has been reached on which multimodal design offers optimal benefit to road safety. Icons iconically map the real world and are associated with fast recognition and response time. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether visual and auditory icons will benefit the effectiveness of audiovisual multimodal warnings. Thirty-two participants (16 females) experienced four types of unimodal warnings (high and low mapping visual warnings and high and low mapping auditory warnings) and four types of audiovisual warnings (high mapping visualÂ +Â high mapping auditory warning, low mapping visualÂ +Â low mapping auditory warning, high mapping visualÂ +Â low mapping auditory warning, and low mapping visualÂ +Â high mapping auditory warning) in simulated driving conditions. Visual warnings are presented in a head-up display. Results showed that multimodal warnings outperformed unimodal warnings (i.e., modality effect). We found mapping effect in audiovisual warnings, but only high mapping auditory constituents benefited warning effectiveness. Eye movement results revealed that the high mapping constituents might distract drivers from the road. This study adds evidence that multimodal warnings can offer extra benefits to drivers and high mapping auditory signals should be included in multimodal warning design to achieve better driving performance.","Multimodal Warning, Audiovisual warning, Mapping, Auditory icon, Head-up display",Yuwei Wang and Bohan Wu and Shu Ma and Duming Wang and Tian Gan and Hongyan Liu and Zhen Yang,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002854,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103638,0003-6870,2022,103638,99,Applied Ergonomics,Effect of mapping characteristic on audiovisual warning: Evidence from a simulated driving study,article,WANG2022103638

"Improper manual material handling (MMH) techniques are shown to lead to low back pain, the most common work-related musculoskeletal disorder. Due to the complex nature and variability of MMH and obtrusiveness and subjectiveness of existing hazard analysis methods, providing systematic, continuous, and automated risk assessment is challenging. We present a machine learning algorithm to detect and classify MMH tasks using minimally-intrusive instrumented insoles and chest-mounted accelerometers. Six participants performed standing, walking, lifting/lowering, carrying, side-to-side load transferring (i.e., 5.7Â kg and 12.5Â kg), and pushing/pulling. Lifting and carrying loads as well as hazardous behaviors (i.e., stooping, overextending and jerky lifting) were detected with 85.3%/81.5% average accuracies with/without chest accelerometer. The proposed system allows for continuous exposure assessment during MMH and provides objective data for use with analytical risk assessment models that can be used to increase workplace safety through exposure estimation.","Manual material handling, Activity classification, Lifting load and frequency estimation",Mitja Trkov and Duncan T.

"Recently, ergonomics and safety researchers have turned their attention towards applying combinations of sociotechnical methods rather than using single methods in isolation. In the current research, a mixed-method approach combining two systems-based methods, Accimaps and the Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Process - Causal Analysis using Systems Theory (STAMP-CAST), and one cognitive approach, the Perceptual Cycle Model (PCM), were employed in analysing a rail-level crossing incident in Bangladesh. Each method was applied individually to investigate the collision, and interventions were proposed corresponding to incident events at different risk management framework levels. The three methods provided different perspectives of the whole picture, together identifying an array of contributory factors. The complementary nature of these methods aided in proposing a comprehensive set of safety recommendations, thereby demonstrating the benefit of a mixed-method approach for collision investigation in low-income settings.","Accimap, STAMP-CAST, PCM",Omar Faruqe Hamim and Shahnewaz Hasanat-E-Rabbi and Mithun Debnath and Md Shamsul Hoque and Rich C.

"Data-linked Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) images can be delayed up to 20Â min in the cockpit. Pilots' underappreciating or ignoring the time delay may be the major cause of two fatal accidents. No studies have connected spatial awareness with accidents. This study evaluated how delayed radar information affects the spatial awareness of pilots at three levels of analysis. Thirty-one student pilots and flight instructors completed three sequential estimation tasks (i.e., the current location of storms, the current relative distance to storms, and the future relative distance to storms). Fifty-four weather scenarios were developed for three factors (storm speeds, delays, displays) and presented to pilots. The results indicated that delays and the storm speed significantly affected the three levels of spatial awareness. Participants' estimation accuracy was the lowest under long delay and fast speed in the current location estimation, under medium delay and speed in the current distance estimation, and under short delay and slow speed in the future distance estimation. Spatial awareness could be high under the long delay and fast speed conditions if pilots had no time limits. Thus, pilots can process 20-min delayed radar information. However, there were no differences in estimation accuracy between the static and animation displays in any of the conditions. Well-designed features on displays, such as scale or distance measuring tools, can aid pilotsâ?? spatial estimation and support all levels of spatial awareness.","Spatial awareness, Distance estimation, NEXRAD display",Lesheng Hua and Chen Ling and Rick Thomas,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002453,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103598,0003-6870,2022,103598,98,Applied Ergonomics,Effects of delayed weather radar images on pilotsâ?? spatial awareness,article,HUA2022103598
"Background Health information technologies (HITs) are increasingly being used to support the self-management of chronic diseases. However, patientsâ?? initial or continued acceptance of such technologies is not always achieved. Objective The aim of this study was to develop a theory-driven HIT acceptance model to examine factors affecting acceptance of HIT (measured by behavioral intention; BI) for disease self-management among patients with chronic diseases, in which we also focused on three additional, previously unexplored factors related to perceived hand function (PHF), perceived visual function (PVF), and perceived space adequacy (PSA) and a longitudinal scrutinization of changes in the effects of these factors on acceptance over time. Methods The theoretical basis of our acceptance model was drawn from the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior. The model was further extended by including patients' PHF, PVF (related to patients with chronic diseases who are mostly elderly), and PSA (related to the patientsâ?? home environment). The model was tested in the context of type 2 diabetes and hypertension self-management via a touchscreen tablet-based system over a 24-week period. A questionnaire was administered at four time points (baseline and 8, 16, and 24 weeks after implementation) to collect data from 151 patients with coexisting type 2 diabetes and hypertension. We tested the model at each time point using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results Perceived usefulness of the self-management system influenced BI directly at 8 and 24 weeks and indirectly at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Perceived ease of use indirectly affected BI at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Attitude directly affected BI at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Perceived behavioral control directly influenced BI at baseline and 8 and 16 weeks. Subjective norms indirectly influenced BI at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. PHF and PVF indirectly influenced BI over the entire study period. PSA influenced BI directly at 16 weeks and indirectly at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Conclusion The effects of the proposed factors in our model on patient-focused HIT acceptance changed over a longer time period, emphasizing the importance of further investigation of the longitudinal mechanisms influencing technology acceptance behavior. It is recommended that healthcare practitioners consider such changes when implementing comparable technologies. Moreover, beyond technology attributes, the characteristics, needs, and limitations of older adults and elderly patient users and their home environments should also be considered in the design and implementation of patient-focused HIT systems for chronic disease self-management at home.","Health information technology, Self-management, Technology acceptance, Longitudinal examination",Kaifeng Liu and Calvin Kalun Or and Mike So and Bernard Cheung and Bill Chan and Agnes Tiwari and Joseph Tan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021003148,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103667,0003-6870,2022,103667,100,Applied Ergonomics,"A longitudinal examination of tablet self-management technology acceptance by patients with chronic diseases: Integrating perceived hand function, perceived visual function, and perceived home space adequacy with the TAM and TPB",article,LIU2022103667
"Despite both the environmental and financial benefits of eco-driving being well known, the psychological impact of engaging in eco-driving behaviours has received less attention within the literature. It was anticipated that being asked to engage in eco-driving behaviours not only has an impact on vehicle fuel usage, but also on the driver, both in terms of their overall mood and willingness to re-engage with the task at a later time. Results from a simulated driving study suggest that although eco-driving was beneficial in reducing fuel consumption, being asked to eco-drive had a negative effect on overall journey time and mood. Engaging in eco-driving did however have a positive effect on self-esteem, suggesting potential longer term psychological benefits of adopting this behaviour.","Fuel consumption, Eco-driving, Subjective states",Craig K.

"Falls on icy surfaces are among the top causes of injuries for workers exposed to the outdoor environment. Our recent field study showed that a new generation of winter footwear incorporating composite outsoles was able to reduce slips and falls on icy surfaces by 68% and 78%, respectively. The widespread adoption of this type of footwear may lead to substantial reductions in pain, suffering and costs of fall-related injuries. However, these composite materials are sensitive to wear and abrasion, which makes it likely that their slip-resistance performance may degrade with use. The goal of this pilot study was to determine the extent to which the slip-resistance of two types of winter footwear with composite outsoles changed as they wore down with real-world use. Seven participants were recruited for this study and were asked to walk 100K steps with their assigned footwear. Tread depth and slipâ??resistance performance (using the Maximum Achievable Angle test) were measured at baseline and again after each 25K-step interval up to 100K. Our results showed that the slip-resistance performance of the test footwear dropped significantly after the 75K and 100K step intervals compared to baseline. In addition, significant changes in tread depth were found after only 25K steps. These findings indicate that the performance of this type of footwear degrades relatively quickly with real-world use. Therefore, larger scale study of the slip-resistance of winter footwear with composite outsoles is needed and members of the public should be made aware of the potential loss of slip-resistance of these products.","Wear, Falls, Ice, Slip-resistance, Footwear, Winter, Slips-and-falls",Z.

"Stress impairs motor performance, which is exacerbated with age. Stress also impairs brain activity in the prefrontal cortex, which communicates with the motor areas of the brain to regulate exercise and motor performance. To develop ergogenic strategies for the aging workforce, mind (brain)-body mechanisms behind the effect of stress on neuromuscular performance need to be well understood. This study investigated the influence of social stress on motor performance and information flow between the frontal and motor regions of the brain during intermittent handgrip contractions among older adults. Thirty older adults, balanced by gender, performed intermittent handgrip contractions at 30% of maximum strength before and after being subjected to a social stressor. Force steadiness, strength loss, root mean square electromyogram (EMG) activity, activation of the brain regions, and functional and effective connectivity between the frontal and motor brain regions were computed for pre- and post-stressor handgrip contractions. Older men exhibited improved motor performance after the stressor and concomitant reduction in functional connectivity between the frontal-motor brain regions ipsilateral to the contracting hand. Additionally, while both sexes exhibited significant causal information flow, i.e., effective connectivity, from the frontal to the motor regions of the brain, irrespective of the stressor, older women exhibited a bidirectional effective connectivity between the frontal-motor brain regions after the stressor. Stress had a facilitative effect on the motor performance of older men through compensatory brain network reorganization. Older women exhibited comparable motor performance pre/post stress, despite showing an increase in bidirectional information flow between the frontal-motor areas. Employing brain hemodynamics can facilitate better understanding of the impact of stress on neuromuscular performance and its differential impacts on brain network reorganization between the sexes.","Aging, Connectivity, Stress, fNIRS, Neuroergonomics",Oshin Tyagi and Ranjana K.

"Ecological Interface Design (EID) is a framework for developing dynamic interfaces that support operators to understand and take appropriate actions within highly-complex systems. This two-part study involved the development and evaluation of a novel EID-based static aviation risk management display. A within-subjects survey-based experiment employed measures of decision accuracy, situation awareness, user workload, usability, and user perceptions. Results from 23 participants showed that when compared to a risk interface utilised by a large aviation company, the EID display achieved higher usability and lower workload ratings with large effect sizes, with no differences in decision accuracy and situation awareness. The findings provide evidence that the EID framework can improve upon static traditional displays. Research contributions also include a novel model of an aviation ground operations system and an example application of EID to the development of a static display. Further research is necessary to identify the extent of the applications and benefits to static displays.","Ecological interface design (EID), Work domain analysis (WDA), Risk management, Data visualisation",Brandon J.

"Auditory comfort evaluations are garnering increased attention in engineering and particularly in the context of air transportation. Being able to produce sound environments corresponding to various flight conditions in aircraft mock-ups would be a valuable tool to investigate acoustic comfort inside aircrafts in controlled environments. Before using such mock-ups, they must be developed and validated in physical and perceptual terms. This paper provides a perceptual validation of sound environment reproduction inside aircraft mock-up. To provide a faithfully reproduced sound environment, time, frequency and spatial characteristics should be preserved. Physical sound field reproduction approaches for spatial sound reproduction are required while properly preserving localization cues at the listener's ears to recreate a realistic and immersing sound environment. We report a perceptual validation of a sound field reproduction system developed in an aircraft mock-up based on multichannel least-square methods and equalization. Twenty participants evaluated reproduced sound environments relative to a reference sound environment in an aircraft cabin mock-up equipped with a 41-actuator multichannel sound reproduction system. Results indicate that the preferred reproduction corresponds to the best physical reconstruction of the sound environment.","Auditory comfort, Sound environment reproduction, Multichannel equalization, Aircraft cabin, Mock-up",O.

"1 Abstract Studying the acceptance of exoskeletons in industry has gained increased attention. Exoskeletons (wearable support devices) are envisioned to alleviate heavy work. Examining what factors influence the use of exoskeletons is important, because influencing these factors could positively contribute to the adoption of industrial exoskeletons. The factors identified in this paper have been systematically derived from empirical research with (potential future) end users, most of whom have tried on an exoskeleton. Our framework with factors influencing the acceptance of industrial exoskeletons can be used during the (ideally iterative) design, (re)development and evaluation phase of new or existing exoskeletons. This could improve the quality of exoskeletons since this allows designers to already consider acceptance factors early in the design process instead of finding out what is important late in the design process during (field) testing. In turn, this might accelerate the adoption of exoskeletons. Also, our framework can be used to study the ongoing introduction of exoskeletons at work since it also addresses policy decisions companies interested in implementing exoskeletons should consider.","Acceptance, Industrial exoskeletons, Use, Usage, Comfort, Technology acceptance, Discomfort, Human-machine interaction",Shirley A.

"Historically, PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) has generally been designed around the size and shape of an average European or US white man's face and body. There is little academic evidence to support anecdotal reports that women are at a greater disadvantage than men from ill-fitting PPE. This is especially relevant in healthcare settings where women make up at least 75% of frontline workers. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated problems associated with the fit of PPE that until now have been mainly anecdotal. This research presents results and analysis of a quantitative and qualitative survey concerning the fit of PPE worn by 248 healthcare workers, in a variety of healthcare roles and settings, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of the survey results showed that women were less likely than men to feel safe carrying out their roles, with only 30.5% of women and 53.3% of men stating that they felt safe all of the time. A statistically significant link is made between women suffering more with poor fit than men with certain categories of PPE (gowns, masks, visors, goggles). Over four times as many women (54.8%) as men (13.3%) reported their surgical gowns being large to some degree and women were nearly twice as likely (53.5%) to experience oversized surgical masks than men (28.6%). However, it was recognized that PPE fit problems are not exclusive to women as many men also do not conform to the underlying shape and size of PPE designs. Survey results indicated that both sexes felt equally hampered due to the fit of their PPE and around a third of both women and men had modified their PPE to address fit issues. Oversized and modified PPE presents its own set of unintended consequences. Following strict processes for doffing and removing PPE is key to virus control but doffing modified PPE can fall outside of these processes, risking cross infection. In addition, wearers of critical items of PPE (such as respirators) currently undergo a â??fit testâ?; however, fit does not reconcile with comfort and over-tightened PPE can cause headaches, discomfort and distraction when worn for long periods. Requirements and fit tests are also not setting-specific; qualitative responses from the survey give an indication that this must be a future consideration.","PPE, Personal protective equipment, Heathcare workers, Safety, Masks, Respirators, COVID-19, Pandemic, Fit",D.J.

"This study compares human climbing performance, including climbing speed and movement and force patterns, between rail- and rung-climbing styles for a moderate aerial ladder slope (52.5Â°). Hand and foot movements and forces were recorded for 9 male and 10 female firefighters as they ascended and descended a 3.4-m ladder using elevated handrails (rail-climbing) or rungs (rung-climbing) for hand support. The results indicated that climbers used three or more points of contact 54% of the time for rung-climbing and 100% of the time for rail-climbing. Furthermore, rail-climbing was 10% faster than rung-climbing. In rail-climbing, the lateral hand forces were mostly directed away from the body; while during rung-climbing, they were alternated in lateral and medial directions. Overall, the results suggested that rail-climbing provides better control over body positioning and faster climbing speed. Furthermore, the continuous contact of both hands in rail-climbing may reduce the fall risk by facilitating the recovery from a slip or perturbation.","Aerial ladder, Hand support, Climbing speed, Points of contact",Qianyi Albert Fu and Peter Simeonov and Hongwei Hsiao and Charles Woolley and Thomas J.

"The aim of this study was to analyze the performance and attentional effects of sending voice messages while driving as compared to calling and texting. To this end, participants were asked to drive a given path while they either receive a phone call, send voice messages, or send text messages on a given cell phone, as well as a control condition. Driving performance, eye tracking, and subjective measures were collected. The results showed that voice messaging, while not as detrimental to driving performance as texting, does lead to similar levels of visual and cognitive distraction as texting and is generally more distracting than calling. Drivers also seem to be unaware of the dangers of voice messaging while driving. This research provides the basis for improved guidelines and legislation and more targeted awareness campaigns that emphasize the dangers of voice messaging while driving on a level with other banned practices.","Voice messaging, Texting, Driving distraction, Driving simulator, Eye tracking",Dana Monzer and Assem {Abou Ali} and Maya Abou-Zeid and Nadine Marie Moacdieh,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000151,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103692,0003-6870,2022,103692,101,Applied Ergonomics,Voice messaging while driving: Effects on driving performance and attention,article,MONZER2022103692
"Introduction Incident reporting and learning systems are a fundamental component of safety management. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel incident reporting system specific to the Australian Led Outdoor Activity (LOA) sector. The Understanding and Preventing Led Outdoor Accidents Data System (UPLOADS), is a recently introduced systems thinking-based incident reporting and learning system that utilises contemporary safety theory and methods. Method The implementation of UPLOADS was evaluated using the RE-AIM framework based on the following dimensions: Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance. A pragmatic evaluation approach was used in which evaluation data were collected through the triangulation of multiple sources including different LOA stakeholders from both the individual organisational level (LOA providers) and LOA sector governance level (LOA industry representatives), incident data collected through the UPLOADS National Incident Dataset, and the online and physical presence of UPLOADS. Results The findings show that a key strength of UPLOADS is its effectiveness as incident reporting tool for improving safety in the LOA sector. However, a weakness of UPLOADS is that it is not being implemented appropriately by the LOA providers. Conclusion Overall, the current findings suggest that UPLOADS incident reporting tool is perceived by SMEs as an effective tool for improving safety in LOA. However, further work is required for UPLOADS to have a greater impact on the LOA sector. Specifically, Implementation of the UPLOADS system requires improvement, as well as additional training and education may be required to upskill and empower LOA providers to improve reporting and enhance the value placed on safety by LOA stakeholders. The RE-AIM framework was an appropriate evaluation framework for understanding the effectiveness of UPLOADS as a LOA sector specific incident reporting and learning system. Practical applications The current findings have practical implications for ergonomics researchers applying evaluation frameworks in the real world, and LOA providers for implementing safety interventions. Lastly, contemporary systems-based incident reporting and learning systems have the capability to enhance the safety practices of the LOA sector.","RE-AIM, Led outdoor activity, Incident reporting, Systems analysis, AcciMap",Scott McLean and Lauren Coventon and Caroline F.

"A large component of Neville Stanton's work has focused on situation awareness in domains such as defence, transport, and process control. A significant contribution has been to initiate a shift from considering individual human operator situation awareness to considering the situation awareness of human and non-human teams, organisations, and even sociotechnical systems. Though controversial when introduced, the distributed situation awareness model has become increasingly relevant for modern day systems and problems. In this article we reflect on Stanton's contribution and point to a pressing need to consider a. The situation awareness of advanced technologies, and b. situation awareness at a sociotechnical system, societal and even global level. This is demonstrated via discussion on two contemporaneous issues: automated vehicles and the COVID-19 pandemic. It is concluded that, given advances such as artificial intelligence, the increased connectedness of society, emerging issues such as disinformation, and an increasing set of global threats, Stanton's distributed situation awareness model and associated analysis framework provide a useful toolkit for future Human Factors and Ergonomics applications.","Situation awareness, Distributed situation awareness, Distributed cognition, Systems thinking, Sociotechnical systems",Paul M.

"It can be inferred from hand-arm impedance analyses that the grip forces of users have a great influence on the transmitted vibrations. To determine this influence on test benches, the state of research suggests a cylindrical measuring handle. Since this shape is not suitable for all power tool handles, we develop a design for a knob-shaped measuring handle. The grip force applied to an orbital sander was measured in a test person study. The recorded data was combined with a 3D scan and evaluated by an algorithm which determined the separation plane of the measuring handle to integrate the force sensors. This plane is perpendicular to the vector of the subjectsâ?? grip forces. Furthermore, it divides the knob-shaped handle of the sander primarily vertically. The determination of the separation plane enables the design of a knob-shaped measuring handle for grip force measurement to analyze the hand-arm impedance of an overlying hand position.","Hand-arm vibration, Grip force, Measuring handle",Tassilo SchrÃ¶der and Andreas Lindenmann and Sophia Hehmann and Andreas Wettstein and RenÃ© Germann and Thomas Gwosch and Sven Matthiesen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002222,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103575,0003-6870,2022,103575,98,Applied Ergonomics,Use of data-driven design for the development of knob-shaped handles in the context of impedance measurements,article,SCHRODER2022103575
"This case-series study aims to investigate the effects of a passive shoulder support exoskeleton on experienced workers during their regular work shifts in an enclosures production site. Experimental activities included three sessions, two of which were conducted in-field (namely, at two workstations of the painting line, where panels were mounted and dismounted from the line; each session involved three participants), and one session was carried out in a realistic simulated environment (namely, the workstations were recreated in a laboratory; this session involved four participants). The effect of the exoskeleton was evaluated through electromyographic activity and perceived effort. After in-field sessions, device usability and user acceptance were also assessed. Data were reported individually for each participant. Results showed that the use of the exoskeleton reduced the total shoulder muscular activity compared to normal working conditions, in all subjects and experimental sessions. Similarly, the use of the exoskeleton resulted in reductions of the perceived effort in the shoulder, arm, and lower back. Overall, participants indicated high usability and acceptance of the device.

"Through a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effects of an electro-magnetic active seat suspension that reduces exposure of a long-haul truck driver to whole body vibration (WBV) on low back pain (LBP) and disability. Among 276 drivers recruited from six trucking terminals of a major US trucking company, 135 eligible drivers were assigned to either having an Active Seat (Intervention: nÂ =Â 70) â?? the BoseRideÂ® electro-magnetic active seat â?? or Passive Seat (reference: nÂ =Â 65) â?? a new version of their current seat (passive air suspension seat) â?? installed in their truck via block (terminal) randomization. Low back pain (LBP) severity, on a 0â??10 scale and the Oswestry LBP Disability Index were collected before and 3-, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-months post seat installation. LBP severity and LBP disability scores were significantly lower post seat installation in both groups. At 3 months, LBP severity decreased -1.4 [95% CI: -2.1 to -0.7: n = 46] for drivers in the Active Seat arm, and â??1.5 [95% CI: -2.3 to -0.8: n = 41] for drivers in the Passive Seat arm. In a subset of drivers, WBV exposures were collected before and after the seat installation. WBV exposures significantly decreased post seat installation for Active Seat (pÂ <Â 0.01) but not for Passive Seat (pÂ =Â 0.15). While the new seat-suspension technology reduced WBV exposures, LBP appeared to be improved by multiple factors. These results were limited by the secondary prevention approach and the longer-term loss to follow up due to large rates of driver turnover typical for the industry.","Whole body vibration, Work related musculoskeletal disorders, Transportation, Professional drivers",Jack T.

Methods Two hundred women were surveyed to determine the most common mopping system, mopping patterns and type of flooring used in their homes. The biomechanical demands of the three most common mopping systems were then evaluated in the laboratory. Participants were also asked to rate their perceived levels of exertion and cleanliness of each mopping system. Results The use of wet wipes had the highest repetition count and exertion rates during mopping and scrubbing tasks. Higher peak scrubbing forces were noted for the plunge mop. All participants found the cotton fibre mop to be the cleanest. All 3 mops had medium postural risk.

"Resilient performance in socio-technical systems is usually described as stemming from people's self-organization and spur-of-the-moment actions and decisions. However, this is not exclusive with work system design ahead of time, with the deliberate intention of influencing resilient performance. This paper proposes a concept and principles of Design for Resilient Performance (DfRP), making explicit contributions that had been concealed and fragmented in the literature. Based on a literature review of influential human factors studies, 23 design principles were identified and set a basis for a Delphi study with 27 experts from nine countries. After three Delphi rounds, consensus was obtained and the DfRP concept was defined as well as seven design principles, namely: (i) there must be functional models of the system; (ii) make variations in performance visible; (iii) use the type of standardization that best fits the nature of the function; (iv) design slack resources and strategies; (v) design for acceptable performance even under degraded conditions; (vi) design must involve leveraging diverse perspectives; and (vii) design to support continuous learning at the individual and organisational level. The applicability of the principles is demonstrated through an exploratory case study of the rapid response team in a hospital. The principles of DfRP are contributions of prescriptive nature, which might give rise to more resilient socio-technical systems.","Resilient performance, Delphi method, Design, Complexity, Rapid response teams",Claudia Maria Dias Guerra Disconzi and Tarcisio Abreu Saurin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000308,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103707,0003-6870,2022,103707,101,Applied Ergonomics,Design for resilient performance: Concept and principles,article,DISCONZI2022103707
"Now and in the coming years a new European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) is being deployed on a larger scale. In the system level chosen in the Netherlands (Level 2) lineside signals will disappear and the train driver will receive all information needed for safe and efficient train operation through an interface inside the train cab. Furthermore, procedures, driving skills and communication will alter. Many train drivers will thus need to be trained in driving with ERTMS. Train operating companies (TOC) have to decide on efficient and effective strategies to organise this extensive training volume and to reassure that drivers become and remain proficient after training when roll-out of ERTMS may not have been fully completed. In this paper the central questions to be answered are: How many hours/duties does a driver have to do during a certain period of time on an ERTMS track section to become proficient with ERTMS (learning period), and to stay proficient (retaining period)? The approach taken is unique for rail industry (to the authors' knowledge) and is based on big data analyses. In this study, we were able to study the collective performance of train drivers, by big data analysis while at the same time maintaining privacy through pseudonymisation of the train driver database and their individual performances, characteristics and other potential privacy sensitive data. Databases containing detailed information on all planned and accomplished train service times/positions of the last three years (2015â??2017) of a large TOC were combined with personal data from HR databases (age, experience, ERTMS training history, job assessment results, etcetera). From the data, delays caused by rolling stock and train operating related issues were identified. The amount and duration of these delays were correlated with the personal data to test research hypotheses. Again, at the same time we maintained privacy of the individualsâ?? personal data. Although the research has some limitations due to the small amount of existing ERTMS lines, and associated rolling stock, the results show some clear correlations. Thus, quantifiable directions to the minimum amount of ERTMS driving per 3 months during the first year and in the years after are presented. The results are now being translated into models for training and rostering related to the phase of ERTMS roll-out.","ERTMS, Competences, Rail, Train drivers, Big data, Training, Experience",Richard {van der Weide} and Vincent {van der Vlies} and Frank {van der Meer},https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702100274X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103627,0003-6870,2022,103627,99,Applied Ergonomics,Train driver experience: A big data analysis of learning and retaining the new ERTMS system,article,VANDERWEIDE2022103627
"The aim of this research was to examine how broadband noise which is present in many workplaces affects dynamic decision-making. The effect of potential moderating factors, cognitive workload and sex, were also examined. Forty-eight participants (24 females) with an average age of 27.38 years (SDÂ =Â 12.34) were asked to complete a dynamic decision-making task over three consecutive-days. Independent variables were Noise (Broadband - 0dBA vs. 75dBA above background) and Cognitive Workload (Low vs. High, manipulated via presence of a secondary task). Among females, broadband noise significantly impaired performance in low workload, but significantly improved performance in high workload. In contrast, among males broadband noise had no significant effect on overall performance. From an applied perspective, understanding the interaction between noise, cognitive workload and sex allows for the design of a training environment to ensure maximum performance by all staff.","Noise, Dynamic decision-making, Safety, Cognitive workload",Hang Zhou and Brett R.C.

"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of face masks by the public has helped to slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the community. Cloth masks have been recommended because of their effectiveness, availability, and reusability. Like other types of face masks, however, user discomfort while wearing cloth masks is thought to engender behaviors that limit the effectiveness of cloth masks as source control (e.g., adjusting or removing one's mask temporarily while in public). To design cloth masks that are more tolerable, a measurement instrument for assessing subjective user discomfort is needed. Across two studies, we identified and confirmed a two-dimensional factor structure underlying the discomfort of cloth masks â?? discomfort related to the breathability and discomfort related to the tightness of the mask against the face and head. Additionally, we provide replicable evidence that both factor-subscales predict the self-reported frequencies of problematic mask-wearing behaviors.","COVID-19, Cloth face masks, Discomfort",Joel M.

"Objective To investigate the disparity in the specification and physiological demand of a task simulation when developed by two independent panels of experiential experts. Design Independent groups design. Methods Two groups of experiential experts from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) worked independently to design, and then complete a simulation of a generic occupational task; the establishment of a security control point. Task duration, oxygen consumption, and cardiac frequency were measured whilst each panel completed the task simulation. Maximal acceptable work duration (MAWD) and the percentage of MAWD (%MAWD) were also calculated. Independent t-tests were used to determine differences (PÂ <Â 0.05) between the measured variables. Results No differences were observed in the average oxygen consumption (1.26Â Â±Â 0.25Â LÂ minâ??1 and 1.28Â Â±Â 0.29Â LÂ minâ??1 respectively; PÂ =Â 0.84), or cardiac frequency (134Â Â±Â 16.4 beatsÂ·minâ??1 and 125Â Â±Â 8.5 beatsÂ·minâ??1 respectively; PÂ =Â 0.12) between Panel 1 and Panel 2. However, there was a significant difference between panels with respect to task duration (Panel 1: 15.5Â Â±Â 3.68Â min; Panel 2: 34.20Â Â±Â 9.60Â min; PÂ <Â 0.01), and the %MAWD (Panel 1: 5.32Â Â±Â 3.17%, Panel 2: 12.15Â Â±Â 9.40%, PÂ =Â 0.04). Conclusions The physiological demand of a task simulation is dependent upon the group of experts consulted to develop the simulation. It is critical that input from a wide representation of experiential experts is considered when developing task simulations to avoid bias towards the perceptions of the experts consulted.","Task, Physical requirements, Simulation, Employment standards, Health, Well-being",Adam C.

"To better understand the assessment of motor variability (MV) in an occupational context, this study determined the role of task constraints on MV and consistency in individual MV responses. Twenty participants performed repetitive lifting under four constraints differing in restriction of foot movement and load weight. MV was assessed for three body regions and for the whole-body using linear variability of three-dimensional joint angles. Foot movement caused significant increases of lower body (11â??17%), low back (318â??439%) and a reduction in upper body variability (4%), whereas no effects of weight nor interaction of foot restriction and weight were found. Good individual consistency (ICCÂ =Â 0.71â??0.84) was demonstrated across constraints. Even though MV is affected by constraints, this study supports that MV is largely an individual trait independent of constraints. Future work should evaluate if MV remains an individual trait across different tasks, and if MV is confounded by other task constraints.","Motor variability, Task constraints, Individual consistency",Nathalie M.C.W.

"Searching for targets among distractors in visual scenes can be more difficult due to the presence of clutter. However, studies in various domains have shown differentiated effects according to the expertise of the searcher. The present study extended these findings to the domain of action video games expertise. 58 participants, split in 2 groups (action video game players and non-action video game players) searched for targets in visual scenes under two clutter conditions (uncluttered and high clutter). Reaction times and accuracy served as measures of performance, and the visual behavior was assessed using the number and duration of eye fixations. Our findings suggest that visual clutter has a negative influence on performance and alters the visual behavior during visual search in action video game scenes. Our results also suggest that expert action video game players might use different visual strategies to cope with clutter, leading however to no performance benefits.","Display clutter, Background complexity, MOBA, Eye-tracking, Visual search",Maxime Delmas and LoÃ¯c Caroux and CÃ©line Lemercier,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002751,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103628,0003-6870,2022,103628,99,Applied Ergonomics,Searching in clutter: Visual behavior and performance of expert action video game players,article,DELMAS2022103628
"A key to the development of more effective interventions to promote movement and reduce physical inactivity in office workplaces may be to measure and locate individual's spatial movement. Using an activity space estimation method, high resolution location data collected from 15 office workers over 12 days were used to estimate and analyse the location and extent of their daily spatial movement whilst in an office work-based setting. The results indicated that the method, kernel density estimation, combined with location data offers significant opportunities to not only measure and compare spatial movement behaviours but also simultaneously identify the locations where the behaviours occur. Combined with other data streams, this method will allow researchers to further investigate the influence of different environmental characteristics on these behaviours, potentially leading the development of more effective, longer lasting interventions to promote movement and reduce stationary behaviour, ultimately improving the health of office workers.","Office, Spatial behaviour, Physical inactivity, Home range, Activity space, Sensors",Brett Pollard and Lina Engelen and Fabian Held and Richard {de Dear},https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002477,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103600,0003-6870,2022,103600,98,Applied Ergonomics,"Activity space, office space: Measuring the spatial movement of office workers",article,POLLARD2022103600
"Firefighters run a risk of heat strain during occupational tasks. The number of female firefighters has been increasing, but research relevant to this group is still scarce.

"Whole-body powered exoskeletons (WB-PEXOs) can be effective in reducing the physical demands of heavy occupational work, yet almost no empirical evidence exists on the effects of WB-PEXO use. This study assessed the effects of WB-PEXO use on back and leg muscle activities during lab-based simulations of load handling tasks. Six participants (4M, 2F) completed two such tasks (load carriage and stationary load transfer), both with and without a WB-PEXO, and with a range of load masses in each task. WB-PEXO use reduced median levels of muscle activity in the back (â?¼42â??53% in thoracic and â?¼24â??43% in lumbar regions) and legs (â?¼41â??63% in knee flexors and extensors), and mainly when handling loads beyond low-moderate levels (10â??15Â kg). Overall, using the WB-PEXO also reduced inter-individual variance (smaller SD) in muscle activities. Future work should examine diverse users, focus on finding effective matches between WB-PEXO use and specific tasks, and identify applications in varied work environments.","Human augmentation, Occupational exoskeleton, Electromyography",Hanjun Park and Sunwook Kim and Maury A.

"Serious falls occur frequently on stairs with inconsistent dimensions. Inconsistent smaller goings are thought to reduce user's foot clearances and foot contact lengths since individuals do not detect and alter their behaviour prior to the inconsistency, increasing the risk of a trip, heel-catch or over-step and potential slip on the stairs. So far, these mechanisms for a stair fall remain theoretical only. The aim of this paper was to identify the underlying mechanisms by which steps with inconsistent going size increase the risk of falls. For this study twenty-seven younger adults (24Â Â±Â 3Â y, 1.74Â Â±Â 0.09Â m, 71.41Â Â±Â 11.04Â kg) and thirty-three older adults (70Â Â±Â 4Â y, 1.68Â Â±Â 0.08Â m, 67.90Â Â±Â 14.10Â kg) ascended and descended a seven-step instrumented staircase in two conditions: 1) consistent dimensions with 200Â mm risers and 250Â mm goings and 2) inconsistent going dimensions where the going of the third step was reduced by 10Â mm, and consequently the going of the second step was larger by 10Â mm. Five repeated trials on the inconsistent stairs were performed to assess if there was an adaptation effect after first exposure. In descent in the first inconsistent trial, foot contact lengths were not significantly different between conditions for the younger and older adults on the inconsistently shorter step (â?¼1%, pÂ =Â .121). Foot trajectories were pulled further back in the last 22% of swing before contact (pÂ =Â .025), contradicting previous expectations. Younger adults then had reduced clearances over the next step (â?¼5Â mm, pÂ =Â .027), which was inconsistently longer, increasing the risk of a heel-catch, whereas foot clearances for older adults were not different. With repeated inconsistent trials the foot contact length of older adults reduced on the shorter step (pÂ =Â .024). In ascent, in the first inconsistent trial, interaction effects were detected between groups and conditions on three steps: the inconsistently longer step (pÂ =Â .003), the shorter step (pÂ =Â .004), the next step (pÂ =Â .006), as well as on the walkway (pÂ =Â .048). Older adults positioned themselves further away from the stairs on the walkway compared to younger adults and then had a reduced foot contact length on the inconsistently shorter step (â?¼2.8%, pÂ =Â .026), increasing the chances of under-stepping and slipping off the shorter step. Whereas younger adults were positioned closer to the stairs on the walkway, had increased foot contact lengths on the inconsistently longer step and contact lengths that were not different on the inconsistently shorter step. With repeated inconsistent trials, foot contact lengths were reduced on the longer step (pÂ =Â .006) and then on the shorter step (pÂ =Â .018). These findings contradict previous assumptions that individuals do not adapt to inconsistent goings on stairs. In descent on the first trial, both groups adjusted their stepping behaviour late in the swing prior to contact with the first inconsistent step. In ascent younger adults made changes to their position and stepping behaviour before stepping on the stairs. These behaviours to mitigate the risk of the inconsistent step, did not persist in the repeat trials. Future investigations should establish the magnitude at which inconsistencies are detectable and can be acted upon and should include a wider range of individuals. This type of research could help inform future initiatives to prevent serious stair falls.","Stair, Inconsistent going, Stepping behaviour",Natasha Francksen and Thijs Ackermans and Denis Holzer and Constantinos Maganaris and Mark Hollands and Mike Roys and Thomas O'Brien,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103678,0003-6870,2022,103678,101,Applied Ergonomics,Underlying mechanisms of fall risk on stairs with inconsistent going size,article,FRANCKSEN2022103678

"Few studies have simultaneously explored the training effects of exergame and video game. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exergame and video game training on cognitive and physical function in healthy older adults. Eighty-four healthy older adults were randomly assigned to exergame training group, video game training group, and control group. Cognitive and physical function was measured before and after the training. Both training groups improved in verbal memory and aerobic endurance, but the training effects were greater in the exergame training group. The exergame training group also showed significant improvement in lower limb strength and balance. The current study provides evidence that exergame training, incorporating both cognitive engagement and physical activity, exerts greater benefits than cognitively engaging video game training alone.

"This study aims to explore the effects of noise and music types on nurses' anxiety, mental workload and situation awareness during an operation. Participants included 20 circulating nurses (CNs) and 16 nurse anesthetists (NAs) who completed a total of 70 operations in which each operation required one CN and one NA. The experiment was separated into a control group (operating noise only) vs. an experimental group (3 different music types-between subjects and 2 music volume levels-within-subjects). Results showed that all participants had excellent situation awareness performance despite their mental workload showing significant differences in various phases of the surgery. Music at 55â??60Â dB caused lower mental workloads and anxiousness for nurses than those exposed to levels of 75â??80Â dB. When Mozart's music was played, the participants' mental workload and situation anxiety were lower than when exposed to other music types. Music played at 60Â dB during an operation may be a feasible solution to mitigate the negative effects of extra noise and thus improve the nurses' performance.","Anxiety, Operating room, Mental workload, Music, Situation awareness",Li-Ping Tseng and Mao-Te Chuang and Yung-Ching Liu,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002805,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103633,0003-6870,2022,103633,99,Applied Ergonomics,"Effects of noise and music on situation awareness, anxiety, and the mental workload of nurses during operations",article,TSENG2022103633

"Netherlands Railways has developed driver advisory systems (DAS) to provide the train driver with route context information and coasting advice in order to benefit punctuality and energy efficiency. However, the impact of these DAS on human factors aspects and safety performance is unclear. The current study assesses the impact of two DAS levels (route context information and coasting advice) on mental workload, attention allocation and safety performance, using eye tracking, a subjective mental workload rating scale (RSME) and simulator data. The overall findings suggest that the application of DAS levels has no negative impact on safety performance and attention allocation towards the trackside compared to a control condition with static timetable information. Furthermore, safety performance benefits significantly from DAS with route context information. DAS were originally developed to benefit punctuality and energy efficiency goals. This study implicates that DAS can also benefit safety performance. The current study found that DAS could decrease workload when the functionalities meet the requirements of the situation. The possible presence of mental underload and its effect on driving performance should be taken into consideration when implementing DAS. It is essential in the development of DAS that it meaningfully enriches the train driving task in stead of simply increasing mental workload.","Driver advisory system, Workload, Attention allocation, Train driver performance, Railway safety, Simulator, Eye tracker, Human factors",Vera JMP.

To measure perception variations associated with different sit:stand ratios, 16 people used six ratios (30:0, 27:3, 24:6, 21:9, 18:12 and 15:15) within 30-min cycles in their normal office environment. At start and end of each workday, study participants recorded their perception of 11 factors on a 10-point scale. Musculoskeletal discomfort in 10 body regions was measured before and after exposure to sit-stand ratios. Overall preferred ratios were recorded. Sit:stand ratio affected all perceived factors, with impact varying. Standing at least 6Â min improved results most overall; however, individual perceived factors were least impacted by any of 30:0, 27:3, 24:6 or 21:9. Preferred sit:stand ratios were 15:15, 18:12 and 21:9. Typically, least liked ratios involved briefest standing (30:0, 27:3, 24:6) although two participants least liked 15:15. Understanding these variations contributes to appropriate standing dosage recommendations.","Perception, Office ergonomics, Musculoskeletal disorders, Workstation design, Sit-stand",Nancy L.

"Trust is a critical factor that drives successful human-automation interaction in a myriad of modern professional environments. One seminal work on human-automation trust is Muir and Moray (1996) showing that human-machine trust evolves from faith, then dependability, and finally predictability in a simulated supervisory control task. However, our recent work failed to replicate the finding of the original study, calling for further replication efforts. Experiment 1 aimed to fully replicate Muir and Moray (1996) where participants performed a simulated pasteurizer task. Experiment 2 attempted to replicate Experiment 1 using participants who major in Engineering as used in the original study. Both experiments showed that dependability was the best initial predictor of trust, building later to predictability and faith. Two experiments consistently failed to support both the hypothesis proposed by Muir and Moray (1996), that trust develops from predictability to dependability to faith, and their original findings that trust develops initially from faith. The results of the current experiments challenge this widely cited view of how human-machine trust develops. Modern automation designers should be aware that dependability might control initial trust development for general users and incorporate dependability information into their designs.","Human-machine trust, Human-machine system, Supervisory control",Shelby K.

"This study examined whether a repetitive light assembly task could be performed according to different movement sequences identified as ways of doing (WoD), and whether the age of the participants or the work pace affected the number of WoDs selected by each participant, or the kinematic parameters for each WoDs. For two work paces, 62 right-handed men in 3 age-groups were asked to fix a handle on a base with 2 nuts without discontinuity for a period of 20Â min; no assembly procedure was demonstrated. The WoDs were characterized by a cross tabulation video coding method, and by measuring vertical force applied and the parameters of upper limb kinematics, as well as these measuresâ?? approximate entropy (ApEN). Five main different WoDs were used. Although most participants varied their WoD, neither participant age nor work pace affected the number of WoD they used. However, the WoDs differed from each other by the sequence of movements and by the level of ApEn of their kinematic variables without interfering with the production rate. Allowing operators to vary their WoDs when performing repetitive tasks could reduce strain on the locomotor system.","Repetitive task, Variability, Age, Pace",Martine A.

"Neglecting a critical auditory alarm is a major obstacle to maintaining a safe environment, especially in aviation. Earlier studies have indicated that tasks with a higher perceptual or cognitive load in the visual modality influence the processing of auditory stimuli. It is unclear, however, whether other factors, such as memory failure, active neglect, or expectancy influence the effect of cognitive load on auditory alarm detection sensitivity during aeronautical decision-making. In this study, we investigated this issue in three laboratory experiments using the technique of signal detection analysis, in which participants were asked to make a landing decision based on indicators of the instrument landing system while also trying to detect an audible alarm. We found that the sensitivity of auditory alarm detection was reduced under conditions of high cognitive load and that this effect persisted even when the auditory detection response occurred first (before the landing decision response) and when the probability of an auditory alarm was 40%. However, the sensitivity of auditory detection was not influenced by cognitive load under high expectancy conditions (60% probability of alarm presentation). Furthermore, the value of the response bias was reduced under high cognitive load conditions when the probability of an auditory alarm was low (20%). With an increase in the level of expectancy (40% and 60% probability of alarm presentation), it was found that cognitive load did not influence the response bias. These findings indicate that visual cognitive load affects the sensitivity to an auditory alarm only at a low expectancy level (20% and 40% probability of alarm presentation). The effect of cognitive load on the sensitivity to an auditory alarm was not due to memory failure or active neglect and the response bias was more sensitive to the expectancy factor.","Inattentional deafness, Cognitive load, Auditory alarm, Expectancy",Rongjuan Zhu and Ziyu Wang and Xiaoliang Ma and Xuqun You,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002763,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103629,0003-6870,2022,103629,99,Applied Ergonomics,High expectancy influences the role of cognitive load in inattentional deafness during landing decision-making,article,ZHU2022103629
"Due to current measurement, sizing and fitting approaches, poor bra fit is prevalent amongst larger breasted women. The impact of improving bra fit hasn't yet been explored. This pre-clinical study aimed to explore immediate and short-term biomechanical responses to changing breast support garment. Asymptomatic participants (n=24) performed a static standing task, drop jumps and seated typing whilst kinematic data from the breasts and spine were recorded. Three breast support conditions were assessed: Usual, professionally fitted bra in the immediate term (PFB), and the same professionally fitted bra after four weeks wear (PFB28). Bra fit assessments were included for both bras. All participants failed the bra fit assessment when wearing the Usual bra and 67% (n=16) failed when wearing the PFB. Less bra fit issues were present in the PFB, resulting in immediate biomechanical changes relating to breast support and spinal posture, yet nothing in the short term (PFB28). This research sets the foundations for future work to investigate whether the implementation of better fitting breast support garments can influence musculoskeletal pain amongst larger breasted women, whilst attributing potential improvement of symptoms, objective measures of breast support and spinal posture.","Breast support, Bra fit, Breast biomechanics",Lauren Haworth and Karen May and Jessie Janssen and James Selfe and Ambreen Chohan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000242,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103701,0003-6870,2022,103701,101,Applied Ergonomics,"The impact of breast support garments on fit, support and posture of larger breasted women",article,HAWORTH2022103701
"Slip and fall injuries can be prevented through footwear with good friction performance. The factors that contribute to friction in non-slip-resistant (NSR) shoes are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to determine whether predictive models for slip-resistant (SR) shoes also apply to NSR shoes. This study also quantified the contributions of under-shoe fluid drainage to friction in NSR shoes. The coefficient of friction (ACOF) and under-shoe fluid pressures of fifteen NSR shoes were measured. A previously developed ACOF prediction model based on measurable outsole features was applied to the NSR shoes. The previously developed model did not apply well (in trends, as indicated by interaction effects involving SR/NSR classification, or in magnitude, pÂ <Â 0.001) to NSR shoes. Instead, an increase in the fluid pressures were associated with a reduction in ACOF (pÂ <Â 0.001). This study demonstrates that fluid pressures dominate performance in NSR shoes in contrast to SR shoes.","Slips, Trips, And falls, Coefficient of friction, Footwear",Emily E.

"Eye tracking has been applied to train novice drivers and clinicians; however, such applications in aviation are limited. This study develops a gaze-based intervention using video-based, expert commentary, and 3M (Mistake, Mitigation, Mastery) training to instruct visual flight rule student pilots on an instrument cross-check to mitigate the risk of losing aircraft control when they inadvertently enter instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). Twenty general aviation student pilots were randomized into control and experimental groups. Dwell time, return time, entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and deviations from flight paths were compared before and after training to straight-and-level-flight (LF) and standard left level turn (LT) scenarios. After the training, the experimental pilots significantly increased dwell time on primary instruments (PIs), reduced randomness in visual search, and fixated on the PIs in shorter times (in the scenario of LT). In terms of piloting, all experimental pilots successfully kept the aircraft control while five control pilots lost control in IMC; significant differences in altitude and rate of climb deviations were observed between groups (in the scenario of LF).","General aviation pilots, Gaze-based training intervention, Eye tracking technology",Nima Ahmadi and Matthew Romoser and Christian Salmon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002891,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103642,0003-6870,2022,103642,100,Applied Ergonomics,Improving the tactical scanning of student pilots: A gaze-based training intervention for transition from visual flight into instrument meteorological conditions,article,AHMADI2022103642
"Histopathologists make diagnostic decisions that are thought to be based on pattern recognition, likely informed by cue-based associations formed in memory, a process known as cue utilisation. Typically, the cases presented to the histopathologist have already been classified as â??abnormalâ?? by clinical examination and/or other diagnostic tests. This results in a high disease prevalence, the potential for â??abnormality primingâ??, and a response bias leading to false positives on normal cases. This study investigated whether higher cue utilisation is associated with a reduction in positive response bias in the diagnostic decisions of histopathologists. Data were collected from eighty-two histopathologists who completed a series of demographic and experience-related questions and the histopathology edition of the Expert Intensive Skills Evaluation 2.0 (EXPERTise 2.0) to establish behavioural indicators of context-related cue utilisation. They also completed a separate, diagnostic task comprising breast histopathology images where the frequency of abnormality was manipulated to create a high disease prevalence context for diagnostic decisions relating to normal tissue. Participants were assigned to higher or lower cue utilisation groups based on their performance on EXPERTise 2.0. When the effects of experience were controlled, higher cue utilisation was specifically associated with a greater accuracy classifying normal images, recording a lower positive response bias. This study suggests that cue utilisation may play a protective role against response biases in histopathology settings.","Histopathology, Cue utilisation, Response bias",A.J. Carrigan and A.

"Informal caregivers for persons living with dementia (PLWD) require interventions that incorporate caregiving context. We used the Patient Work System model to characterize caregiving context by identifying work system constraints experienced by caregivers during dementia care events (e.g., managing behavioral symptoms of dementia) and strategies used to overcome constraints. We conducted twenty semi-structured interviews with caregivers. We performed upward abstraction and strategy mapping and identified seven work system constraints and eight strategies used to overcome constraints across three care events. We found that strategies used by caregivers either directly modified a constraint or emphasized other positive work system components to overcome a constraint. For example a caregiver modified their bathroom to support the PLWD in bathing themselves properly and safely. These findings provide an understanding of how real-world context influences how caregivers deliver dementia care and the design and implementation of systems that support dementia caregivers.","Patient work system, Constraints, Strategy, Dementia, Caregivers",Dustin T.

"Most female soldiers report that in-service body armour systems are too large. We investigated whether a smaller prototype body armour system could improve thoracolumbar range of motion (ROM) and reduce interference when female soldiers performed dynamic postures. 97 female soldiers completed three ROM tasks and seven dynamic postures wearing no armour, an in-service body armour system, and a smaller prototype system. Feedback on comfort of the prototype system was also obtained. Thoracolumbar ROM and dynamic posture completion were both hindered by using body armour, although the participantsâ?? performances were significantly less impeded when they wore the smaller prototype system compared to the in-service system. A smaller body armour system that is better matched to the anthropometric dimensions of female soldiers appears to improve overall fit and function. An increased range of body armour sizes and female-specific designs should be systematically explored to further enhance fit and function of body armour.","Range of motion, Dynamic postures, Comfort, Body armour, Female soldiers",Celeste E.

"Background Dual-task interference is a concern when users attempt to use head mounted displays (HMD) while performing seated manual control tasks. Auditory warnings of information displayed on the HMD may or may not assist users while multi-tasking. Objective In this study, we investigated the dual-task interference of words, to be remembered later, presented on a HMD and motor control in a manual tracking task. The word presentations were warned or not warned with auditory signals and the impact of audio warnings were examined. Methods Participants were required to perform five tasks: (1) a compensatory tracking task performed alone, (2) a word memory task performed alone, (3) a tracking and word memory task, (4) a word memory task with words preceded by audial signals, and (5) a tracking and word memory task with words preceded by audial signals. In addition, in the dual-tasks, half of the word presentations were paired with directions changes in the tracking task to test for immediate perceptual interference. Results There were significant dual task costs for both mean tracking error and later word recall. Additionally, participants took significantly longer to respond to motion changes paired with word presentations than motion changes not paired with word presentations. However, the impact of auditory warnings on tracking performance was nuanced. Conclusion Even with an in field of view transparent HMD momentary and sustained cognitive dual-task interference remains. Reaction times are affected most in the worst case scenario, when task critical events occur at the same time as a text message. Application The use of HMDs in time critical manual control tasks (such as operating machinery) should be limited. The use of audial warnings to alert operators to information displayed on an HMD requires further research; it may disrupt appropriate or natural task ordering.","Attention, Auditory alerts, Dual-task, Head-mounted display, Mobile, Tracking, Wearable",Matthew D.

"Few studies have investigated preferred driving posture involving real-world driving. For this purpose, seven preferred joint angles of 127 participants were recorded three times from sagittal plane photographs after a short, standardized drive on public roads. Participants' individual driving posture preferences were determined using a word-based questionnaire. The inter- and intraindividual joint angle differences were calculated and some significant effects of stature, age, and gender on these joint angle differences were found. Additionally, significant correlations were found between posture preferences and joint angles, except for the lower extremities. The results show that the factors stature, age, gender, and posture preferences have influence on the preferred joint angles. However, other human-, vehicle-, and context-related factors also seem relevant and should be considered in future studies.

"The aim of this study was to examine the impact of backpack load carriage on lower limb strength and loading rate change in a cohort that match military recruit profiles. Twenty-six participants walked on a treadmill either carrying a military load carriage system (32 kg) or unloaded for 2 h on two consecutive days. Participants ground reaction forces and strength measures were assessed using a force platform and dynamometry, respectively. Testing included assessments before and after treadmill walking on days one and two, and 24 h following day 2. When assessed by mixed methods ANOVA (alpha: 0.05) statistically significant interaction effects were observed for loading peak (p = 0.031), loading rate (p = 0.035) and plantarflexor torque dynamometry variables at 60Â°sâ??1 (p = 0.011) and 120Â°sâ??1 (p = 0.024). Repeated measures correlation highlighted associations between plantarflexor torque at 60Â°sâ??1 and loading rate (r = â??0.901, p < 0.001). Load carriage reduced lower limb torque which did not recover between days. Plantarflexor torque reductions were associated with increases in loading rate. Practitioners should consider that load bearers are more likely to experience lower limb injury during multi-day load carriage. Future work should develop protocols to reduce plantarflexor torque loss in order to reduce ground reaction force change.","Loading peak, Loading rate, Plantarflexors, Neuromuscular function",James Scales and Damian Coleman and Mathew Brown,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000400,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103717,0003-6870,2022,103717,101,Applied Ergonomics,Multiday load carriage decreases ability to mitigate ground reaction force through reduction of ankle torque production,article,SCALES2022103717
"There have been recent calls for Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) to expand its reach and focus to address larger scale societal and global issues. An area of growing awareness is the issue of the gender data gap, whereby women are under-represented in research data, leading to inequitable outcomes when research findings are used to design real world technologies, products, environments, processes, and policies. The aim of this paper is to showcase how structured HFE methods can be used to address the gender data gap. We applied the Sociotechnical Systems Design Toolkit which involved using causal loop diagrams and abstraction hierarchy modelling from Cognitive Work Analysis to understand the system in which the issue occurs and key pain points, followed by the application of the Design with Intent Toolkit to generate design ideas. A total of 43 ideas were developed that could be implemented by universities to address the research data gap. The application demonstrates the utility of HFE methods in tackling complex issues and offers an opportunity for the HFE community to reflect upon the importance of gender sensitive research practices and gender equity more broadly.","Gender data gap, Gender equity, Sociotechnical systems design toolkit, Causal loop diagram, Abstraction hierarchy, Design with intent toolkit",G.J.M.

"It is well known that exposure to light at the right time of the day is important to synchronise our circadian rhythm and enhance cognitive functioning. There is, however, a lack of field studies investigating which lighting characteristics are necessary to improve sleep and cognitive functioning. A controlled field study with 80 shift workers was set up, in which the impact of an integrative lighting (IL) scenario was investigated during the morning shift. Two groups were compared: a control group (no change in lighting settings) and a IL-group (exposed to a melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance of 192 lux, i.e., bright light with a high fraction of short-wavelengths). Pre-post measurement of visual comfort, cognitive functioning (D2 task, go-nogo reaction time task) and sleep (MotionWatch8) were performed. The IL-settings ameliorated sleep efficiency and sleep latency during morning shift and enhanced alertness (not inhibition) compared to standard lighting conditions.

"Digital human modeling (DHM) technology is considered the state of the art in designing and evaluating workstations. Previous studies examined the differences between DHM's posture and motion prediction relative to human experimental data. Yet, the effect the two different inputs on biomechanical loads was not assessed. Therefore, this study evaluates the differences in L4/L5 compression force and shoulder torques during a work process calculated using DHM with motion prediction (Jack by Siemens) and DHM with experimental data. The work process is a sequential removing, carrying, and depositing task performed by nine females and nine males and recorded using a motion capture system. The analysis shows that using experimental data results in larger back compression force during the removing task (average 15.4%), similar force during the depositing task (average 0.68%), and less force during the carrying task (19.875%). Using experimental data resulted in larger shoulder torque during all tasks (average 24.97%).","Digital human modeling, L4/L5 compression force, Simulation",Zohar Potash and Yaar Harari and Raziel Riemer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021003227,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103675,0003-6870,2022,103675,101,Applied Ergonomics,Effect of using real motion versus predicted motion as input for digital human modeling of back and shoulder loads during manual material handling,article,POTASH2022103675
"Exoskeletons have shown significant impact at reducing the biomechanical demand on muscles during repetitive lifting and overhead tasks in non-healthcare industries. However, the benefits of exoskeletons are yet to be realized in the operating room, particularly as work-related musculoskeletal disorders continue to be a concern for surgeons. This study quantified the effect of using neck, arm, and trunk exoskeletons on muscle activity while assuming typical postures held in the operating room. Fourteen participants were recruited to participate in this study. In this two-part experiment participants were asked to 1) hold a series of neck flexion, arm abduction and trunk flexion postures seen in surgical procedures, and 2) perform a simulated surgical task requiring five different trunk flexion posture levels. Participants were required to complete these tasks with and without passive exoskeleton(s). This study showed that even for postures held short time periods, exoskeletons are beneficial at reducing the demand on muscles; however, the reduction in muscle demand depends on body segment and postural angle, as intended with these passive exoskeletons. Furthermore, for the simulated surgical task with awkward trunk flexion postures (10â??65Â°), the trunk exoskeletons showed a significant reduction in the rate of rise in back muscle sEMG (+1.365%MVC/min vs. +0.769%MVC/min for non-dominant lumbar extensor muscles, pÂ =Â 0.0108; +1.377%MVC/min vs. +0.770%MVC/min for the dominant lumbar extensor muscles, pÂ =Â 0.0196) over 25Â min, consequently resulting in improved trunk subjective discomfort scores (7.34 vs. 4.30, pÂ <Â 0.05), with no impact on the neck and shoulder biomechanical demand.

"There is a recent trend to place more emphasis on noise non-auditory effects. Despite its implications on health, there is a lack of recommendations for noise in occupational settings. This study aimed to present occupational exposure limits for noise-induced non-auditory effects in healthy males using empirical exposure-response regression models based on the data of laboratory and ï¬eld considering the effective variables. To this end, the equivalent noise level was measured and recorded in four working settings including closed offices, open-plan offices, control rooms, and industrial workplaces during a normal working day. They were 65, 68, 73, and 80dB(A), respectively. In the laboratory, 31 healthy males were exposed to five noise conditions (four noisy conditions and one quiet) during 8 h and they were asked to perform the cognitive tests. In the ï¬eld phase, 124 healthy males were also examined from four working settings in their workstations for 8 h. The psychophysiological parameters of the participants were recorded in both lab and field. The results indicated variations in mental responses at levels above 55dBA, and psychophysiological variations at levels above 70dB(A) in both phases. The findings also showed that the developed regression models could plausibly predict the noise-induced psychophysiological responses during exposure to noise levels; thus, they can be presented the likely exposure limits. Based on the results of the models, the levels <55dB(A) are likelihood of the acoustic comfort limit, and the levels ranged from 55 to 65dB(A) are the acoustic safe limits. The acoustic caution limit is the likelihood of the levels ranged from 65 to 75dB(A). The levels ranged from 75 to 80dB(A) are likely the action levels or control limits, and the occupational exposure limit are the probability of levels> 80dB(A).","Occupational exposure limits, Non-auditory effects, Prediction models, Occupational noise",Rostam Golmohammadi and Ebrahim Darvishi and Masoud {Shafiee Motlagh} and Javad Faradmal and Mohsen Aliabadi and Matilde A.

"While care transitions influence quality of care, less work studies transitions between hospital units. We studied care transitions from the operating room (OR) to pediatric and adult intensive critical care units (ICU) using Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS)-based process modeling. We interviewed twenty-nine physicians (surgery, anesthesia, pediatric critical care) and nurses (OR, ICU) and administered the AHRQ Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture items about handoffs, care transitions and teamwork. Care transitions are complex, spatio-temporal processes and involve work during the transition (i.e., handoff and transport) and preparation and follow up activities (i.e., articulation work). Physicians defined the transition as starting earlier and ending later than nurses. Clinicians in the OR to adult ICU transition without a team handoff reported significantly less information loss and better cooperation, despite positive interview data. A team handoff and supporting articulation work should increase awareness, improving quality and safety of care transitions.","Process mapping, Care transition, Communication and coordination",Abigail R.

"This study examines the impact of the sound environment on spatial knowledge acquisition in a virtual outpatient polyclinic. Outpatient polyclinics have a salient role in determining early outpatient treatments of COVID-19 to prevent hospitalization or death and reduce the burden on hospitals. However, they have not been widely investigated in the literature. The studies on spatial knowledge have identified environmental elements mainly related to vision with no focus on sound. Currently, there is limited research on the effect of sound environment on spatial knowledge acquisition in virtual outpatient polyclinics. In this study, a virtual simulated outpatient polyclinic has been created with varying levels of visual and audio cues. Eighty participants were assigned to one of the four groups: a control (no visual signage), a visual (visual signage), an only audio (no landmarks and no visual signage), and an audio-visual group. The virtual environment was presented as a video walkthrough with passive exploration to test spatial knowledge acquisition with tasks based on the landmark-route-survey model. The results showed that a combination of visual signage and sound environment resulted in higher spatial knowledge acquisition. No significant difference was found between the performance of the visual group and the control group that shows that signage alone cannot aid spatial knowledge in virtual outpatient polyclinics. Data from the only audio group suggests that landmarks associated with sound can compensate for the lack of visual landmarks that may help design a wayfinding system for users with visual disabilities.","Landmark-route-survey model, Outpatient polyclinics, Sound environment, Spatial knowledge, Virtual environments",Donya Dalirnaghadeh and Semiha Yilmazer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021003197,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103672,0003-6870,2022,103672,100,Applied Ergonomics,The effect of sound environment on spatial knowledge acquisition in a virtual outpatient polyclinic,article,DALIRNAGHADEH2022103672
"Tactile interaction between humans and elements in the built environment, such as furniture, is often underappreciated. The aim of this study was to objectively evaluate thermal properties of ten tabletop materials as well as user perceptions of those materials after use. Sixteen participants tested ten materials in a randomised order. Infrared thermography was used to determine tabletop temperature distribution and change. Materials with lower thermal effusivity (wood-based materials) in general reached higher surface temperature differences after 15Â min of contact and were rated as more pleasant to touch, more suitable for writing, and more liked for everyday use. Participantsâ?? sex and forearm mass had no effect on the temperature after contact. Participants gave the highest ratings to the appearance of oak-based materials. Surface treatment affected subjective evaluation of the materials. The tabletop made of lacquered solid wood had the most favourable thermal and user-rated characteristics.","School desk, Office desk, Ergonomics, Thermal comfort",Nastja {Podrekar Loredan} and Dean Lipovac and Sabina Jordan and Michael David Burnard and Nejc Å arabon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021003112,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103664,0003-6870,2022,103664,100,Applied Ergonomics,Thermal effusivity of different tabletop materials in relation to usersâ?? perception,article,PODREKARLOREDAN2022103664
"Despite growing literature, limited research details the influence of passive upper limb exoskeletons on upper limb kinematics. Two bolting tasks and a tracing task were completed at two heights (overhead and between waist and overhead height) for four exoskeleton conditions (no exoskeleton, and 3 levels of exoskeleton assistance) by female participants. Motion capture data, ratings of perceived exertion and discomfort, and task duration were recorded. Exoskeleton condition increased minimum shoulder elevation by 35â??36% (Î?10.5â??10.7Â°) at 1.81Â kg and 2.72Â kg of support, mean shoulder external rotation by 316% (Î?24.6Â°) at 0.91Â kg of support and mean forearm pronation by 30.9% (Î?14.6Â°) at 0.91Â kg of support. Exoskeleton condition reduced ratings of perceived exertion and discomfort, but not significantly. Task duration was unaffected. Exoskeleton use at any of three different settings modestly affected some joint kinematics for the tasks examined, which may merit consideration when deciding on occupational exoskeleton implementation.","MSD, Upper extremity, Wearable device",Tasha C.

"Low back disorders (LBDs) are a leading injury in the workplace. Back exoskeletons (exos) are wearable assist devices that complement traditional ergonomic controls and reduce LBD risks by alleviating musculoskeletal overexertion. However, there are currently no ergonomic assessment tools to evaluate risk for workers wearing back exos. Exo-LiFFT, an extension of the Lifting Fatigue Failure Tool, is introduced as a means to unify the etiology of LBDs with the biomechanical function of exos. We present multiple examples demonstrating how Exo-LiFFT can assess or predict the effect of exos on LBD risk without costly, time-consuming electromyography studies. For instance, using simulated and real-world material handling data we show an exo providing a 30 Nm lumbar moment is projected to reduce cumulative back damage by â?¼70% and LBD risk by â?¼20%. Exo-LiFFT provides a practical, efficient ergonomic assessment tool to assist safety professionals exploring back exos as part of a comprehensive occupational health program.","Low back disorders, Ergonomic assessment, Exoskeleton, Exosuit",Karl E.

"Healthcare workers must balance competing priorities to deliver high-quality patient care. Rasmussen's Dynamic Safety Model proposed three factors that organisations must balance to maintain acceptable performance, but there has been little empirical exploration of these ideas, and little is known about the risk trade-offs workers make in practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the different pressures that healthcare workers experience, what risk trade-off decisions they make in response to pressures, and to analyse the implications for quality and safety. The study involved 88.5Â h of ethnographic observations at a large, teaching hospital in central London. The analysis revealed five distinct categories of hospital pressures faced by healthcare workers: efficiency, organisational, workload, personal, and quality and safety pressures. Workers most often traded-off workload, personal, and quality and safety pressures to accommodate system-level priorities. The Pressures Diagram was developed to visualise risk trade-offs and prioritising decisions and to facilitate communication about these aspects of healthcare work.","Resilient healthcare, Human factors, Healthcare safety",Natalie Sanford and Mary Lavelle and Ola Markiewicz and Gabriel Reedy and Anne Marie Rafferty and Ara Darzi and Janet E.

"The objective of the present study was to investigate the roles of lower-limb joint proprioception in postural control during gait. Seventy-two healthy adults including 36 younger and 36 older adults participated in two experimental sessions, i.e., lower-limb joint proprioception assessment session and gait assessment session. Lower-limb joint proprioception was assessed by joint position sense errors measured at the ankle, knee and hip of the dominant side. Postural control during gait was characterized by step length, step width and local dynamic stability. Results showed that hip proprioception contributed the most to postural control during gait among the lower-limb joint proprioception components, and that mechanisms for the hip proprioception effects were different between age groups. These findings highlighted the importance of incorporating hip proprioception enhancement exercises in postural control training programs, and the necessity of considering age-related differences in the effects of hip proprioception when designing these exercises.","Falls, Proprioception, Postural control, Gait, Joint position sense",Xingda Qu and Xinyao Hu and Jun Zhao and Zhong Zhao,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002829,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103635,0003-6870,2022,103635,99,Applied Ergonomics,The roles of lower-limb joint proprioception in postural control during gait,article,QU2022103635
"Nurses function at the point of care and assume a significant role in intercepting errors. They work in a mentally and physically demanding profession that is comprised of shift-work, subjecting nurses to considerable fatigue. Yet, few studies constructed a comprehensive model that integrates personal and occupational factors to explore their relationship with various types of fatigue (acute, chronic, physical, mental, and total). Here, we examine this type of comprehensive fatigue-model, in a report that represents one aim of a larger, mixed-methods study. The study sample comprised of 1137 registered nurses working in eight hospitals in a Midwestern state. Nurses reported higher levels of acute and total fatigue than chronic and physical fatigue. Staffing and resource adequacy, exercise, and sleep were among the strongest predictors. Since fatigue is a multi-faceted construct, a comprehensive fatigue-management strategy that targets both day and night-shift nurses is the optimal way to manage nurse fatigue.","Occupational fatigue, Nurses, Shift-work, Sleep",Amany Farag and L.D.

"The present study examined whether the non-chronological age factor, engagement in physical exercise, affected responses to multimodal (combinations of visual, auditory, and/or tactile) signals differently between younger and older adults in complex environments. Forty-eight younger and older adults were divided into exercise and non-exercise groups, and rode in a simulated Level 3 autonomous vehicle under four different task conditions (baseline, video watching, headway estimation, and video-headway combination), while being asked to respond to various multimodal warning signals. Overall, bi- and trimodal warnings had faster response times for both age groups across driving conditions, but was more pronounced for older adults. Engagement in physical exercise was associated with smaller maximum braking force for younger participants only, and also corresponded to longer average fixation durations, compared to the non-exercise group. Findings from this research can help to guide decisions about the design of warning and information systems for semi-autonomous vehicles.","Aging, Physical exercise, Multimodal information presentation",Gaojian Huang and Brandon J.

"Chemical household products are found in most households. If consumers are to safely handle such products, they need to be aware of the risks posed by the particular product they are using. Although most countries require that chemical household products feature warning labels (e.g. the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals), consumers appear to also use other cues to determine the risks associated with a specific product. Thus, we studied the influence of packaging on consumers' risk perception of chemical household products. More specifically, we examined the effect of the colour of the packaging (black or pink packaging versus the original packaging) as well as the presence of images of flowers or food-imitating elements on the packaging. Significant differences with regard to consumer's risk perception were found in terms of all four studied manipulations. Therefore, we conclude that consumers' risk perception can be influenced by the packaging design. In particular, if elements that lower consumer's risk perception (e.g. featuring flowers on the label and food-imitating elements on the packaging) are omitted from the packaging, consumers might be able to more accurately judge the risks associated with a product and so take appropriate safety precautions.","Risk perception, Chemical household products, Packaging design",Kim BuchmÃ¼ller and Angela Bearth and Michael Siegrist,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021003239,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103676,0003-6870,2022,103676,100,Applied Ergonomics,The influence of packaging on consumersâ?? risk perception of chemical household products,article,BUCHMULLER2022103676
"This study presented an alternative technique for processing electromyography (EMG) data with sporadic errors due to challenges associated with the field collection of EMG data. The application of this technique was used to detect errors, clean and optimize EMG data in order characterize and compare shoulder muscular load in farmworkers during apple harvesting in a trellised orchard. Surface EMG was used to take measurements from twenty-four participants in an actual field work environment. Anomalies in the EMG data were detected and removed with a customized algorithm using principal component analysis, interquartile range cut-off and unsupervised cluster analysis. This study found significantly greater upper trapezius muscle activity in farmworkers who used a ladder as compared to the alternative platform-based method where a team of mobile platform workers harvested apples from the tree tops and a second separate team of ground workers harvested apples from the tree bottoms. By comparing the unprocessed and the processed, anomaly-free EMG data, the robustness of our proposed method was demonstrated.","Anomaly detection, Electromyography, Horticulture, K-means clustering, Principle component analysis",Ornwipa Thamsuwan and Peter W.

"In this paper, we discuss the ways in which Neville Stanton has challenged himself, his research colleagues, PhD students, the many co-authors and contributors to his publications, and the entire Ergonomics community to determine what it means for there to be â??consistent standards for how [Ergonomics] methods are described and reported.â?? Only in this way, can it be possible to make claims about whether or not a method in Ergonomics is effective. Given that he is Chartered as both an Occupational Psychologist and an Ergonomist, it is not surprising that he has been concerned with the question of the reliability and validity of Ergonomics methods. In Occupational Psychology, psychometric and personnel selection methods are expected to exhibit acceptable levels of reliability, but this is an expectation which is still somewhat alien to Ergonomics. Neville's work has been instrumental in raising this issue and in providing approaches which can be used to critically evaluate the methods we use. We think that, despite his ground-breaking work, there is still much to do in the Ergonomics community to create the situation for which he has long argued.","Methods, Reliability, Validity, Cost, Benefit",Chris Baber and Mark S.

"To make graphical user interfaces look more fashionable, designers often make use of high-stroke-contrast fonts. We are yet to understand how these fonts affect reading. We examined the effect of letter-stroke contrast on three bold fonts, one with extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes, one with no contrast, and one in between. The fonts were designed for this experiment to enable control of font variables. Participants identified the middle letter in a lowercase letter trigram in each trial, briefly presented in the parafovea (at 2Â° left and right of fixation) and at the foveal fixation point. There was evidence for letter recognition impairment for the font with high stroke contrast compared to the fonts with low and medium stroke contrast, while there was no significant difference in performance between the medium- and low-stroke-contrast fonts. The results suggest that bold fonts with high stroke contrast should not be considered for designs where letter recognition is a priority.","Crowding, Font, Reading, Letter features, Visual acuity",Sofie Beier and Chiron A.T.

"Metacarpal gloves are commonly used in heavy-duty industries such as mining and are typically thicker and bulkier than manufacturing or assembly industrial gloves. This pilot study investigates the impact of wearing metacarpal gloves on hand dexterity, functional capabilities, and perceived comfort. Four types of commercially available metacarpal gloves were selected for evaluation in a randomized controlled trial. Evaluations included turning and placing tests, also grip, pinch, and screwdriver tests, and rating of the perceived level of effort. Dexterity test results showed that metacarpal gloves significantly reduced the ability to perform motor tasks requiring coordination compared to bare hands. Hand functions such as gripping, pinching, and forearm rotations were not significantly affected. However, the perceived level of effort needed to complete those hand functions increased as the metacarpal glove's bulkiness increased. High levels of mechanical protection typically offered by metacarpal gloves can inversely affect hand dexterity and hand exertion.","Hand protection, Grasp, Grip, Pinch, Torque",SueAnn Woods and Eduardo M.

"The delegation of tasks to a non-human agent in a sociotechnical system can extend human capabilities and performance. Effective performance is, however, reliant on a successful relationship between human operators and automation. Optronics is a partially automated system which has replaced periscope on board some modern submarine platforms, operating modes permit the completion of tasks either manually or utilizing automation. A reluctance to utilize automated functionality within the optronics system has been due to operator familiarity with legacy manual procedures based upon the use of a physical periscope. This highlights the gap that is prevalent between innovation, design, training and governance of automation utilization. The current work examined current (Control group) utilization of optronics technology using an expert population in a high fidelity simulator. Findings were utilized to guide the development of novel optronics specific standard operating procedures (Intervention group). Results indicate that automaton disuse was greatly reduced, which had had a positive overall impact on overall system performance with regard to productivity and accuracy.

"The high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) has been a concern in the meat-processing industry, owing to the manual nature of the work and the high upper-limb and neck exposure to movements that can lead to WRMSD. The ability to perform an accurate and fast assessment of WRMSDs remains a challenge in industrial environments. Most assessment methodologies rely on standard survey-based methods, which are time- and labor-intensive. In this paper, we present an application of inertial measurement units (IMUs) to measure human activity, and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to perform task classification and ergonomic assessments in workplace settings. We present the results obtained by using simple low-cost IMUs worn on slaughterhouse worker wrists to capture information on their movements. We describe the use of this information to detect the risk factors of the wrists/hands that can lead to WRMSDs. The results indicate that by using low-cost IMU-based sensors on the wrists of slaughterhouse workers, we can accurately classify the sharpness of the knife and predict the worker RULA score.","Work-related musculoskeletal disorders, Machine learning, Sensors, RULA scores, Slaughterhouse workers",Adolfo Villalobos and Alejandro {Mac Cawley},https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103556,0003-6870,2022,103556,98,Applied Ergonomics,Prediction of slaughterhouse workersâ??

"Military exercises and recruit training requires soldiers, including new recruits, to undergo multiple days of substantial physical stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological impact of multiple days of military load carriage by addressing the hypothesis: A second day of load carriage increases oxygen uptake and reduces knee extensor torque compared to a single day of load carriage. A load carriage group (nÂ =Â 12) (carrying 32Â kg) and unloaded group (nÂ =Â 14) walked on a treadmill for 2Â h on two consecutive days. Knee extensor and flexor torque were assessed by dynamometry at speeds of: 0Â°Â·sâ??1,60Â°Â·sâ??1 and 180Â°Â·sâ??1 before and after load carriage on day one and two, and 24Â h following day 2. Oxygen uptake was assessed via respiratory gas assessment at the 6th and 119th minute of load carriage on day one and two. When assessed by mixed methods ANOVA (alpha: 0.05), an interaction effect was observed for oxygen uptake (pÂ <Â 0.001), with post hoc assessment highlighting second day of load carriage significantly increased oxygen uptake compared to day one post in the loaded group (28.9(3.0) vs 25.8(3.4), pÂ =Â 0.048).

"A curve speed warning system (CSWS) for firetrucks was developed and tested in this study. The CSWS algorithm was developed based on guidelines in the public domain for general vehicles and modified for firetrucks for their configuration and emergency driving. Twenty-four firefighters participated in the test in a driving simulator. The results show that the CSWS was effective in issuing preemptive warnings when the drivers were approaching curves with unsafe speed during emergency responses. Drivers reduced their driving speed at curve approaching and entering phases for most challenging curves, without affecting the overall time in completing the test route.

"A fieldwork study conducted in six units of a major metropolitan Australian hospital revealed that nurses' attitudes towards alarms are influenced by each unit's physical layout and caseload. Additionally, nurses relied heavily on both non-actionable and actionable alarms to maintain their awareness of the status of their patients' wellbeing, and used auditory alarms beyond the scope of their intended design. Results suggest that before reducing or removing auditory alarms from the clinical environment to improve patient safety, it is important to understand how nurses in different clinical contexts use current alarm systems to extract meaningful information. Such an understanding could guide appropriate alarm reduction strategies and guide alternative design solutions to support nurses' situation awareness during monitoring.","Auditory alarms, Healthcare, Situation awareness",Marie-Lys F.A.

"When designing objects, designers attempt to communicate the purpose and meaning of that object to users using various factors such as visual appearance (aesthetic), practical interaction elements (product semantics) and meanings beyond the practical product interaction (semiotics). This study sought to confirm the previous deductively-developed soma-semiotic framework, whose purpose was to understand and ultimately predict the emotional impact of different design elements on users, using one specifically designed object, Fruit Bowl (FB). The purpose of the study reported in this paper was to compare the theoretically derived emotional responses to FB from the soma-semiotic framework with empirically derived data from users in order to improve the framework. Sixty participants evaluated the meaning and emotion conveyed by FB as well as self-reported their own experienced emotions under two scenarios. The framework predicted that FB would convey joy in a first scenario, and amusement in a second scenario based on different movements. Using a weighted vector analysis based on Russell's two-dimensional Circumplex of emotions, users identified that the overall emotion of the first scenario to be similar to the predicted emotion. This was attributed mostly to the bouncy movement of the bowl and its visual aesthetic. However, in the second scenario the overall rating was calm/impressed; rather than humour. The abstract design did not favour users making the same associations as the designer. We recommend that the soma-semiotic framework be revised to include aesthetic, in addition to semiotic and semantic, elements as determinants of user interpretations and reactions to designed objects.","Design and emotion, Artefact meaning, Design with movement, Soma semiotics",Deborah Fels and Alethea Blackler and Kristina Niedderer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001101,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103463,0003-6870,2021,103463,96,Applied Ergonomics,Does bouncy equal happy?

"Although smart infusion pumps were built to eliminate medication errors, new types of usability errors have arisen. The purposes of this study were to determine potential risks when using smart pumps during secondary medication administration and to identify opportunities for design improvements. We observed and analyzed nurses when they interacted with smart pumps and heuristically evaluated the smart pump to identify usability problems. Forty-three usability problems were identified with the smart pump. The usability problems have the potential to create high cognitive burden on nurses and to increase the likelihood of mistakes. We discuss design and process improvement recommendations for each major finding from this study.","Infusion pump safety, Medication errors, Roller clamp, Smart infusion pump, Smart pump usability, Human factors evaluation",Amelia Klarich and Thomas Z.

"Globally, the walker is one of the most common assistive technologies used by older adults with mobility impairments, which is also the case in New Zealand. However, there is a scarcity of knowledge regarding their specific requirements in housing design. Adopting an ethnographic approach, the perceptions and spatial use of 16 older adults who used a walker were investigated as part of a larger study on quality of life and housing design. Five emergent themes for walker user perception and spatial use were identified, from which design considerations were distilled and then categorised into 10 design elements. The study highlights differences between the requirements for accommodating walkers and those for accommodating wheelchair users. It provides new insights into improved housing design for older adults, which have the potential to be incorporated into existing frameworks for accessible design and universal design thereby improving the independence and safety of older adults.","Walker, Senior housing design, Accessibility, Mobility impairments, Inclusive design",Yukiko Kuboshima and Jacqueline McIntosh,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001861,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103539,0003-6870,2021,103539,97,Applied Ergonomics,Housing design that improves the independence and safety for older adults using a walker,article,KUBOSHIMA2021103539
"Aim To determine how anthropometric characteristics cluster in the New Zealand Defence Force, and to describe the characteristics of each cluster. This information can inform the development of new uniform sizing systems for the New Zealand Defence Force. Methods Anthropometric data (nÂ =Â 84 variables) from 1,003 participants (212 females; 791 males) in the New Zealand Defence Force Anthropometry Survey (NZDFAS) were used. The dataset was stratified by gender and variables isolated based on their relevance to shirt and trouser sizing. Principal Component Analysis was used to identify the most important variables for clustering. A combination of two-step and k-means clustering was used to derive cluster characteristics. Results The PCA identified optimal clothing (shirtÂ =Â body height and waist girth; and trouserÂ =Â inseam length and hip girth for females; inseam length and waist girth for males) variables. Two-step and k-means clustering identified optimal cluster numbers of 6 and 10 for female and male clothing, respectively. The female clothing clusters were more variable (intra-cluster) and further apart (inter-cluster) compared to males. Conclusions Anthropometric measurements in combination with clustering techniques show promise for partitioning individuals into distinct groups. The anthropometry dimensions associated with each cluster can be used by the garment industry to develop specific sizing systems for the New Zealand Defence Force population.","Anthropometry, PCA, Cluster analysis, Clothing size, New Zealand Defence force",Stephven Kolose and Tom Stewart and Patria Hume and Grant R.

"Wearable inertial sensors may be used to objectively quantify exposure to some physical risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders. However, concerns regarding their potential negative effects on user safety and satisfaction remain. This study characterized the self-reported daily discomfort, distraction, and burden associated with wearing inertial sensors on the upper arms, trunk, and dominant wrist of 31 manufacturing workers collected over 15 full work shifts. Results indicated that the workers considered the devices as generally comfortable to wear, not distracting, and not burdensome to use. Exposure to non-neutral postures (discomfort, right arm, betaÂ =Â 0.02; trunk, betaÂ =Â â??0.01), non-cyclic tasks (distraction, betaÂ =Â -0.26), and higher body mass indices (discomfort, betaÂ =Â 0.05; distraction, betaÂ =Â 0.02) contributed to statistically significant (pÂ <Â 0.05), albeit practically small increases in undesirable ratings. For instance, for each additional percentage of time working with the right arm elevated â?¥60Â°, self-reported discomfort ratings increased 0.02Â cm on a standard 10Â cm visual analog scale. Female workers reported less discomfort and distraction while wearing the sensors at work than males (discomfort, betaÂ =Â â??0.93; distraction, betaÂ =Â â??0.3). In general, the low ratings of discomfort, distraction, and burden associated with wearing the devices during work suggests that inertial sensors may be suitable for extended use among manufacturing workers.","Wearables, User experience, Musculoskeletal disorders, Inertial Measurement Unit, Exposure assessment, Field measurement",Xuanxuan Zhang and Mark C Schall and Howard Chen and Sean Gallagher and Gerard A.

"Operators' self-assessment has received limited interest within process control or human-system evaluation. Research on self-assessment has been criticised for poor assessment methodology, and consequently, its status is unclear. This study hypothesised that, given adequate assessment methods (such as task-specific assessment items and scenario replay), we could observe relatively accurate self-assessment results. Eighteen licensed operators and two experts assessed team performance in six nuclear control room scenarios. The results reveal an overall agreement between operators and experts, measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient, ranging from 0.60 to 0.70, which lies close to the intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.75 for the experts. This demonstrates potential for achievement of relatively accurate operator self-assessment for complex work. The agreement varied in a similar manner for both expert agreement and operator-expert agreement across eight performance dimensions. In addition, the operatorsâ?? self-assessment provided additional information beyond observer assessment in identifying non-acceptable performance items.","Self-assessment, Expert assessment, Assessment method, Team performance",Per Ã?ivind Braarud,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001472,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103500,0003-6870,2021,103500,97,Applied Ergonomics,Comparing control room operators' and experts' assessment of team performance using structured task-specific observation protocols and scenario replay,article,BRAARUD2021103500
"Aim To develop evidence-based role-specific physical employment standards and tests for National Ambulance Resilience Unit (NARU) specialist paramedics. Methods Sixty-two (53 men, 9 women) paramedics performed an array of (1) realistic reconstructions of critical job-tasks (criterion job performance); (2) simplified, easily-replicable simulations of those reconstructions and; (3) fitness tests that are portable and/or practicable to administer with limited resources or specialist equipment. Pearson's correlations and ordinary least products regression were used to assess relationships between tasks and tests. Performance on reconstructions, subject-matter expert and participant ratings were combined to derive minimum acceptable job performance levels, which were used to determine cut-scores on appropriate correlated simulations and tests. Results The majority of performance times were highly correlated with their respective simulations (range of r: 0.73â??0.90), with the exception of those replicating water rescue (r range: 0.28â??0.47). Regression compatibility intervals provided three cut-scores for each job-task on an appropriate simulation and fitness test.

"A systematic review according to the PRISMA reporting standard was performed to identify causes of use errors in mechanical ventilators described in the literature. The PubMed search resulted in the inclusion of 16 papers. The errors described were systematically analyzed with regard to their causes and categorized in an adapted cause-and-effect diagram. The causes of use errors were related to specific usability issues and to the general condition that medical staff often work with different ventilators. When many devices are used, the different user interfaces are a source of use errors, since, for example, the same ventilation modes have different names. In order to avoid the identified causes for use errors in the future, this work offers manufacturers of ventilation devices design recommendations and the possibility to include the results in their risk management. In addition, standardizing user interface content across all ventilators, as in ISO 19223, can help reduce use errors.","Mechanical ventilators, User centered design, Patient safety",Beatrice Coldewey and Annette Diruf and Rainer RÃ¶hrig and Myriam Lipprandt,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001915,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103544,0003-6870,2022,103544,98,Applied Ergonomics,Causes of use errors in ventilation devices - Systematic review,article,COLDEWEY2022103544

"This work is directed to an understanding as to how the knowledge of, and the application of human factors and ergonomics (HF/E) can save lives. To achieve this, the paper features an assessment of the achievements of one particular scientist, Neville Anthony Stanton, and how his body of contributions has impacted the realm of ground transportation and, in particular, driver behavior assessment. On the widest scale, it is objectively and obviously the case that Stanton is one of the most fecund scientists of our discipline ever. His impact is evident globally and results not simply from the sum total of his written and published works but through an extensive record of international scientific presentations, mutual investigative collaborations across the globe, and mentoring at all levels of the Academy and beyond. As well as mastering and elucidating the HF/E dimensions of a number of content domains, he has generated vital, and even unique tools and methods through which we can explore and understand the problem space of HF/E.

"Manual pushing or pulling with a hand tool is a coordinated action by various upper extremity muscles. The objective of this experimental study was to examine the effects of horizontal and vertical hand loads on upper extremity muscle activity during concentric pushing and pulling exertions. Twenty young female participants conducted repetitive pushing and pulling trials with three horizontal loads (1Â kg, 2Â kg, 3Â kg) and two vertical loads (0.6Â kg, 1.3Â kg) in a seated posture, while the myoelectric activity of seven upper extremity and shoulder muscles were quantified. Study results indicate that the shoulder flexor and extensor muscles were more strongly associated with horizontal load, and elbow flexors were more sensitive to vertical load. The empirical data from this systematic evaluation can offer initial insights for ergonomic design and evaluation of hand tools or occupational tasks that involve repetitive pushing or pulling.","Electromyography, Muscular load, Push and pull, Upper extremity muscles",Donghyun Song and Eunjee Kim and Haerim Bak and Gwanseob Shin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001514,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103504,0003-6870,2021,103504,96,Applied Ergonomics,Effect of hand loads on upper extremity muscle activity during pushing and pulling motions,article,SONG2021103504
"A behaviourally-anchored observational rating scale (BAORS) of teamwork based upon the â??Big Fiveâ?? teamwork model (Salas et al., 2005) was selected and adapted for use in a combat training setting â?? a UK military field gun competition. The teamwork development of 16 newly-formed teams training to master a historic tactical drill was evaluated over the course of a week-long residential programme. Training culminated in a timed field gun competition. Teams were trained and mentored in respects to teamwork and taskwork by experienced military instructors. Teamwork was assessed at the outset and end of training. Significant improvements were evident on all teamwork process dimensions, with the greatest improvement seen in teams' shared understanding of teamwork roles and strategies (shared mental models).

"Human movement is characterized by its variability: the same task is never performed twice in exactly the same way. This variability is believed to play a functional role in movement performance and adaptability, as well as in preventing musculoskeletal damage. This article focuses on the time-evolution of movement variability throughout a repetitive pointing task until exhaustion. The kinematics of 13 subjects performing the pointing task is analyzed. Principal Component Analysis of joint angles identifies joint coordinations for each pointing cycle, and cycle-by-cycle comparison highlights movement variability. Non-supervised clustering reveals that subjects adopt successive coordination patterns at an intra-individual level. Inter-individual variability is characterized by the number and type of such patterns: from 3 to 5 patterns, mobilizing the trunk, the shoulder and the upper limbs differently. Movement variability exists even in a seemingly basic and constrained task. It appears in the very early stages of fatigue onset, and may correspond to adaptative coordination responses throughout task performance. This observation should encourage workstation designers to better account for movement variability in order to preserve operators' health and safety.","Movement variability, Muscle fatigue, Repetitive pointing task, Ergonomic assessment, Principal components analysis, Hierarchical ascending classification",J.

"The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of Kinect body joint detection to facilitate the calculation of energy expenditure during exergame exercises. Two Kinect-based biomechanical models - mechanical energy (KineticE) and work (WorkE) were employed to estimate the energy expenditure during four Wiiâ?¢ exergame session. Consequently, two stepwise regression models were developed from nineteen participantsâ?? data and then validated by five holdout participants. The data collected using an accelerometer (rÂ =Â 0.835, pÂ <Â 0.001) had the highest correlation as compared to that of the WorkE (rÂ =Â 0.805, pÂ <Â 0.001) and KineticE (rÂ =Â 0.466, pÂ <Â 0.001) correlations with the reference indirect calorimetry using Quark activity energy expenditure (QuarkAEE). The regression results show that KineticE and the weight of the participant were significant factors for mechanical energy prediction (AEEKinetic). However, according to the work prediction equation (AEEWork), only WorkE was significant. The new energy prediction models showed significant agreement with the standard QuarkAEE (AEEKinect, rÂ =Â 0.641, pÂ =Â 0.02; AEEWork, rÂ =Â 0.793, pÂ <Â 0.001), and they were comparable to accelerometer predictions (rÂ =Â 0.682, pÂ =Â 0.001). The findings indicate that Kinect can be a potentially viable alternative to measure energy expenditures.

"This work examined the physical demands associated with 4 commercially available direct current right-angle power tools along with their computer controlled fastening strategies. Physical demands were measured via an external instrumented handle that could also control the trigger of each tool. Data revealed that forces recorded by the external handle for each of the 4 tools differed. Independent of Joint-Hardness and Target Torque the Atlas Copco TurboTightÂ® and Cleco Low Torque Reaction fastening strategies, both using a rapid spindle-head rotation strategy, produced the lowest peak and impulse force, respectfully, when compared to the 2 tools that were designed to fasten with a longer duration. This work has shown that short duration fastening strategies provide an ergonomics benefit to the users as it requires less force to operate, such force reduction in previous research has been linked to reduced handle displacement and lower muscle effort.","Right-angle power tool, Manufacturing ergonomics, Physical demands, Power tool comparison",J.

"Laparoscopy is a cornerstone of modern surgical care, with clear advantages for the patients. However, it has also been associated with inducing upper body musculoskeletal disorders amongst surgeons due to their propensity to assume non-neutral postures. Further, there is a perception that patients with high body mass indexes (BMI) exacerbate these factors. Therefore, surgeon upper body postures were objectively quantified using inertial measurement units and the LUBA ergonomic framework was used to assess posture during laparoscopic training on patient models that simulated BMIs of 20, 30, 40 and 50Â kg/m2. In all surgeons the posture of the upper body significantly worsened during simulated laparoscopic surgery on the BMI 50Â kg/m2 model as compared to the baseline BMI model of 20Â kg/m2. These findings suggest that performing laparoscopic surgery on patients with high BMIs increases the prevalence of non-neutral posture and may further increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders in surgeons.","Laparoscopic surgery, Posture, Inertial measurement units, Ergonomics",Ryan Sers and Steph Forrester and Massimiliano Zecca and Stephen Ward and Esther Moss,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001484,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103501,0003-6870,2021,103501,97,Applied Ergonomics,The ergonomic impact of patient body mass index on surgeon posture during simulated laparoscopy,article,SERS2021103501

"Overhead work is known as one of the ergonomic risk factors that can lead to shoulder overload and injury. Anatomical alignment of rotator cuff muscles makes them the most vulnerable to injuries during overhead work. In this study, the effect of task rotation, as one of the administrative controls to reduce the risk of injury during overhead work, on the fatigue response of rotator cuff muscles was investigated. Twelve participants performed three submaximal exertions (5, 20, and 35% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)) using four task rotation sequences (increasing, decreasing, upward parabolic, and downward parabolic). Median frequency of surface electromyography (EMG), shoulder strength, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were used to study the fatigue response of rotator cuff muscles. Although the average normalized muscle activity was similar in all sequences, the task rotation sequence had a significant effect on the median frequency. The effect of task rotation sequence on the strength and RPE was similar to that of the median frequency but was statistically not significant. The upward parabolic task rotation sequence resulted in the lowest fatigue among all the task sequences. Performing intense exertions apart from each other, warm-up exertions, and the presence of active recovery after the intense exertions could be the factors that produced the lowest fatigue during this sequence.","Rotator cuff muscles, Overhead work, Task rotation, Muscle fatigue",Hossein Motabar and Ashish D.

"Exploring what types of app icons are attractive has been a topic of great interest in recent years. The main purpose of this study was to explore the neural mechanism of attention capturing of the anthropomorphic app icons based on neuroergonomics. Participants' perception of different app icons was investigated by using event-related potentials (ERPs) and attractiveness evaluation. The results showed that anthropomorphic app icons were evaluated more attractive and elicted larger P2, P3 and LPP amplitude than non-anthropomorphic app icons, which indicated an attention bias to attractive anthropomprphic app icons. The time course of the attention towards anthropomorphic app icons includes three main processes: an early stimulus-driven perceptual detection of app icon features (P2 during 160â??200Â ms), an involuntary allocation of attention to evaluate and categorize app icons (P3 during 300â??500Â ms), and experiencing different emotions to anthropomorphic versus non-anthropomorphic app icons (LPP during 500â??800Â ms). That is, the process of usersâ?? perception and attention toward app icons combines â??bottom-upâ? and â??top-downâ? processes.

"This study aimed to characterize the effects of walking with backpack load on upper limb function. Fifteen males participated in 3 conditions: no load, 40% body weight loaded backpack (BP) and loaded backpack with simulated rifle (BRC). Pinch strength, grip strength, sensory threshold, blood flow volume, and a manual dexterity test were assessed before and after a 45-min walking trial. Pinch strength in the BP condition was significantly different than the control (pÂ <Â 0.05). Grooved pegboard times were faster after a seated recovery (pÂ =Â 0.026) than immediately after walking with load. Blood flow was significantly decreased to <53% of baseline (pÂ â?¤Â 0.001) in BP and BRC immediately after donning the backpack. No significant changes in grip strength or sensory threshold were measured among conditions or time points. In conclusion, pinch strength, manual dexterity and blood flow were affected by backpack carriage, but other upper limb measures remained unaffected.","Load carriage, Pinch strength, Pegboard",Jennifer L.

"In the workplace, overconfidence is generally considered undesirable as it may increase people's propensity to take risks. In many areas (e.g., aviation, shipping, nuclear control, and driving), risk-taking is detrimental to safety. We hypothesised that decision-makers would be overconfident and, due to group polarisation, decision-making pairs would be more overconfident than single decision-makers. As was predicted, when answering a 24-item general knowledge questionnaire (dÂ =Â 0.94) and a task exploring how they might reorient themselves if lost (dÂ =Â 1.93), participants (NÂ =Â 63) were overconfident about their performance; importantly, participants in pairs (nÂ =Â 32) were more overconfident on general knowledge (Hedges' gÂ =Â 0.51) and lost procedures (Hedges' gÂ =Â 0.52), than were participants who completed the tasks alone (nÂ =Â 31).

"Objective To investigate the effects of repeated work bouts in the heat on peak body core temperature and to explore sex-based differences in body core temperature responses. Methods Fourteen males and fifteen females performed four work bouts (two heavy and two moderate, alternating) in 32.5Â Â°C Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), each separated by 30-min seated rest in 28.0Â Â°C WBGT. Participants wore a military combat uniform with body armour and helmet (10Â kg load) during the work bouts, removing the vest and helmet during recovery periods. Results Body core temperature elevation over time was faster in the first compared with subsequent work bouts of each intensity. Body core temperature elevation was similar between males and females during the first heavy work bout, then remained significantly lower in females for the reminder of the trial. Conclusions Contrary to the assumed progressive elevation in strain, but in agreement with recent literature, a gradual reduction in heat storage in subsequent exercise bouts prevented a cumulative increase in heat strain in the conditions tested.","Thermoregulation, Heat stress, Military",Christopher A.J.

"This study investigated repetitive patterns in the locations of touch errors as a function of the shapes and positions of soft buttons on a smartphone for two-thumb text entry. Forty-three right-handed college students with smartphone-use experience were recruited for testing. An experimental application was developed, and the locations and frequencies of touch errors were measured for the button combinations of seven shapes and eight positions. More than 70.0Â % of touch errors occurred within 2Â mm from the boundaries of the buttons. In terms of direction, touch errors were primarily observed below the buttons, across all the button shapes and positions. Simultaneously, touch errors often appeared on the lateral sides of the buttons: (1) close to the proximal phalange of the thumbs when the buttons were placed near the initial positions of the thumbs and (2) close to the initial positions of the thumbs when the buttons were placed near the top and bottom ends of the keyboard.","Locations of touch errors, Soft keyboard, Smartphone",Hayeon Yu and Keonwoo Nam and Seokwon Shin and Minjung Choi and Youngdoo Son and Joonho Chang,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001885,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103541,0003-6870,2021,103541,97,Applied Ergonomics,Repetitive patterns in the locations of touch errors for two-thumb text entry on a smartphone,article,YU2021103541
"Purpose Nonlinear analysis techniques provide a powerful approach to explore dynamics of posture-related time-varying signals. The aim of this study was to investigate the fundamental interactions between postural variability structure and discomfort development during prolonged standing. Methods Twenty participants, with equal distribution for gender and standing work experience (SWE), completed a simulated long-term standing test. Low back and legs discomfort, center of pressure, lumbar curvature, and EMG activity of trunk and leg muscles were monitored. Nonlinear measures including largest lyapunov exponent, multi-scale entropy, and detrended fluctuation analysis were applied to characterize the variability structure (i.e., complexity) in each signal. The size (i.e., amount) of variability was also computed using traditional linear metrics. Results With progress of low back and legs discomfort over standing periods, significant lower levels were perceived by the participants having SWE. The amount of variability in all signals (except external oblique EMG activity) were significantly increased with the time progress for all participants. The structure of variability in most signals demonstrated a lower complexity (more regularity) with fractal properties that deviated from 1/f noise. The SWE group showed a higher complexity levels. Conclusions Overall, the findings verified variations in structure and amount of the postural variability. However, nonlinear analysis identified postural strategies according to the perceived discomfort in a different way. These results provide supports for future application of nonlinear tools in evaluating standing tasks and related ergonomics interventions as it allows further insight into how discomfort development impact the structure of postural changes.","Complexity, Standing work, Discomfort",Zanyar Karimi and Adel Mazloumi and Ali Sharifnezhad and Amir Homayoun Jafari and Zeinab Kazemi and Ahmadreza Keihani and Iraj Mohebbi,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001368,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103489,0003-6870,2021,103489,96,Applied Ergonomics,Determining the interactions between postural variability structure and discomfort development using nonlinear analysis techniques during prolonged standing work,article,KARIMI2021103489
"This paper is aimed mainly at Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) practitioners. It addresses the sustainability of communities, since without them there is no real human future. It also fits current concerns about climate change and general sustainability. However, our understanding of the characteristics of sustainable communities is still insufficient, as is evidenced by the different perspectives extant in the HFE literature. This paper provides a further perspective based on systems ergonomics, intended both to extend our socio-technical understanding and to assist HFE practitioners in contributing to a broad approach by which to contribute to the never-ending renewal process for these communities. Without such an approach many communities will become unsustainable, with collapse as their end, as Tainter originally, icily, explained (Tainter 1988). The paper begins with a definition of a â??sustainable communityâ??, including its legal basis. Its sustainability goals are outlined, based mainly on principles of social justice, since without people there is no community. Then there is a discussion of the characteristics of sustainable communities, the classes of resources available to maintain sustainability, and some of the complexities and hindrances to this maintenance. The last sections link this conceptual landscape to HFE practice by outlining approaches and processes that move from the conceptual landscape in this paper to current practice.",,M.A. Sinclair and M.J.deC.

"We investigated the effect of participant-selected (PSel) and researcher-selected (RSel) music on urban driving behaviour in young men (NÂ =Â 27; MageÂ =Â 20.6 years, SDÂ =Â 1.9 years). A counterbalanced, within-subjects design was used with four simulated driving conditions: PSel fast-tempo music, PSel slow-tempo music, RSel music and an urban traffic-noise control. The between-subjects variable of personality (introverts vs. extroverts) was explored. The presence of PSel slow-tempo music and RSel music optimised affective valence and arousal for urban driving. NASA Task Load Index scores indicated that the urban traffic-noise control increased mental demand compared to PSel slow-tempo music. In the PSel slow-tempo condition, less use was made of the brake pedal. When compared to extroverts, introverts recorded lower mean speed and attracted lower risk ratings under PSel slow-tempo music. The utility of PSel slow-tempo and RSel music was demonstrated in terms of optimising affective state for simulated urban driving.","Affect, Distraction, Personality, Road safety, Young drivers, Simulation",Costas I.

"Descriptions of resilient performance in healthcare services usually emphasize the role of skills and knowledge of caregivers. At the same time, the human factors discipline often frames digital technologies as sources of brittleness. This paper presents an exploratory investigation of the upside of ten digital technologies derived from Healthcare 4.0 (H4.0) in terms of their perceived contribution to six healthcare services and the four abilities of resilient healthcare: monitor, anticipate, respond, and learn. This contribution was assessed through a multinational survey conducted with 109 experts. Emergency rooms (ERs) and intensive care units (ICUs) stood out as the most benefited by H4.0 technologies. That is consistent with the high complexity of those services, which demand resilient performance. Four H4.0 technologies were top ranked regarding their impacts on the resilience of those services. They are further explored in follow-up interviews with ER and ICU professionals from hospitals in emerging and developed economies to collect examples of applications in their routines.","Resilient healthcare, Resilience abilities, Healthcare 4.0",Valentina {Marques da Rosa} and TarcÃ­sio Abreu Saurin and Guilherme Luz Tortorella and Flavio S.

"Prolonged and intensive vibration exposures during the grinding of handheld workpieces may cause hand-arm vibration syndrome. The objectives of this study are to develop an on-the-hand method for evaluating vibration-reducing (VR) gloves, and to determine whether VR gloves can significantly reduce the vibration exposures. A worker holding and pressing a typical workpiece (golf club head) against a grinding wheel or belt in order to shape the workpiece was simulated, and the input vibration and those on the workpiece and hand-arm system were measured. Ten human subjects participated in the experiment. The results demonstrate that VR gloves significantly reduced the vibrations at the palm, hand dorsum, and wrist. The grinding interface condition and hand feed force did not substantially affect glove effectiveness. The use of gloves slightly increased the workpiece resonant response, but the resonant response did not significantly affect glove effectiveness. This study concluded that the use of VR gloves can help control vibration exposures of workers performing grinding of handheld workpieces.","Hand-arm vibration, Handheld workpiece vibration, Vibration-reducing glove, Anti-Vibration glove",Xueyan S.

"The influence of a passive exoskeleton was assessed during repetitive lifting with different lifting styles (squat, stoop) and orientations (frontal/symmetric, lateral/asymmetric) on trunk and hip extensor muscle activity (primary outcomes), abdominal, leg, and shoulder muscle activity, joint kinematics, and heart rate (secondary outcomes). Using the exoskeleton significantly and partially clinically relevant reduced median/peak activity of the erector spinae (â?¤6%), biceps femoris (â?¤28%), rectus abdominis (â?¤6%) and increased median/peak activity of the vastus lateralis (â?¤69%), trapezius descendens (â?¤19%), and median knee (â?¤6%) and hip flexion angles (â?¤11%). Using the exoskeleton had only limited influence on muscular responses. The findings imply the exoskeleton particularly supports hip extension and requires an adjusted body posture during lifting with different styles and orientations.

"The number of studies on autonomous vehicles has increased over recent years. Many of these studies have indicated the importance of an external Human-Machine Interface of communication (eHMI) on autonomous vehicles to indicate their intentions to other road users. Using an experimental design, we compared three eHMIs coupled to three road infrastructures to observe pedestrians' crossing behavior and collect their feelings about different vehicle types. Our results showed that the eHMIs influence the pedestrians' decision to cross the street, confirming the importance of setting up eHMIs. The proportion of pedestrians who crossed in front of the autonomous vehicles was more significant for vehicles equipped with an eHMI than vehicles without an eHMI. In 10% of cases, pedestrians used circumvention strategies rather than crossing in front of a vehicle without an eHMI. This behavior was more often observed when there was no protected infrastructure. Finally, while our objective data failed to indicate whether a specific eHMI is better accepted than another, the subjective data on the participants' preferences provided some promising ideas for further studies and the eHMI final implementation.","Autonomous vehicle, Pedestrian, Communication system, Road infrastructure, Crossing behavior",Natacha MÃ©tayer and StÃ©phanie Coeugnet,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001253,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103478,0003-6870,2021,103478,96,Applied Ergonomics,Improving the experience in the pedestrian's interaction with an autonomous vehicle: An ergonomic comparison of external HMI,article,METAYER2021103478
"Hand anthropometry is one of the fundamentals of ergonomic research and product design. Many studies have been conducted to analyze the hand dimensions among different populations, however, the definitions and the numbers of those dimensions were usually selected based on the experience of the researchers and the available equipment. Few studies explored the importance of each hand dimension regarding the 3D shape of the hand. In this paper, we aim to identify the dominant dimensions that influence the hand shape variability while considering the stability of the measurements in practice. A novel four-step research method was proposed where in the first step, based on literature study, we defined 58 landmarks and 53 dimensions for the exploration. In the second step, 80,000 virtual hand models, each had the associated 53 dimensions, were augmented by changing the weights of Principle Components (PCs) of a statistical shape model (SSM). Deep neural networks (DNNs) were used to establish the inverse relationships from the dimensions to the weight of each PC of the hand SSM. Using the structured sparsity learning method, we identified 21 dominant dimensions that represent 90% of the variance of the hand shape. In the third step, two different manual measuring methods were used to evaluate the stability of the measurements in practice. Finally, we selected 16 dominant dimensions with lower measurement variance by synthesizing the findings in Step 2 and 3. It was concluded that the recognized 21 dominant dimensions can be treated as the reference dimensions for anthropometric study and using the selected 16 dominant dimensions with lower measurement variance, ergonomists are able to generate a 3D hand model based on simple measurement tools with an accuracy of 5.9Â mm. Though the accuracy is limited, the efforts are minimum, and the results can be used as an indicator in the early stage of research/design.","Dominant hand dimensions, Measurement stability, Structured sparsity learning",Yusheng Yang and Hongpeng Zhou and Yu Song and Peter Vink,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001095,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103462,0003-6870,2021,103462,96,Applied Ergonomics,Identify dominant dimensions of 3D hand shapes using statistical shape model and deep neural network,article,YANG2021103462
"Blueberry production has skyrocketed in the past two decades due to an exponential increase in consumer demand around the world. Hand harvesters are used, avoiding damage to the fruit and increasing harvesting efficiency multifold when compared with that of hand-picking. The downside of these hand harvesters is their high Hand Arm Vibration (HAV), which is very dangerous for the worker and can cause hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). The aim of this study is to propose a spring-based anti-vibration handle that can be attached to vibrating equipment (blueberry hand harvester). Four different parameters were measured for the developed spring-based handles: hand arm vibration, wrist posture, muscle activity, and subjective discomfort rating. Results have shown that the use of a spring-based handle can reduce HAV by 61.1%, which is within the exposure limit values (ELV) defined by the European Union.","Anti-vibration handle, Hand arm vibration, Blueberry hand shaker",Jashwant Thota and Eunsik Kim and Andris Freivalds and Kyongwon Kim,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002180,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103571,0003-6870,2022,103571,98,Applied Ergonomics,Development and evaluation of attachable anti-vibration handle,article,THOTA2022103571
"This study investigates the effects of a dynamic seat pan design on sitting biomechanics, perceived pain and seat movement compared to a control. Thirty male participants were recruited for two experimental sessions consisting of a 2-h sitting exposure (standardized typing task). Spine angles, back muscle activity, perceived pain and calf circumference were measured pre and post exposure. Sitting in the dynamic condition resulted in lower pain ratings (pÂ =Â 0.031), decreased calf circumference (pÂ <Â 0.001), lower average seat pressure (pÂ <Â 0.001), and greater seat contact area (pÂ =Â 0.003) compared to the control. Spine angles and low back EMG for all 6 muscles showed no significant differences between chair conditions. These results suggest this dynamic seat pan design is effective at decreasing several negative components associated with sitting for the occupant.

"The continuing advancement of technology means that sociotechnical systems are primed for revolutionary changes to ways of working that can increase capability. It is critical to consider the unintended impact technology can have on human operators particularly regarding information flow and interactions within teams. Previous research revealed that the co-location of operator's dependent on each other for task relevant information can optimise information flow previously constrained by engineering considerations. The current work compared a novel circular configuration to that of a contemporary submarine control room. In the circular configuration, consoles faced inwards, permitting eye contact between operators, and three large screen displays were introduced to provide all operators with the same information. Ten teams participated in low and high demand dived tracking scenarios in a simulated submarine control room. All communications between operators were recorded in order to generate social, information, and task networks. These were statistically compared to networks generated from a baseline study of contemporary operation. Overall, the volume of verbal communications significantly reduced, information exchange was more structured, and the volume of tasks completed by operators significantly increased when operating in an inward facing circle configuration. The current work provides support for a data driven evidence-based approach to design that is information centric but endorsed by the end user to optimise performance and increase productivity.

"The availability of keyboards with reduced key width has been recently promoted as an ergonomic aid for small-handed pianists to overcome any potential physical disadvantages that may restrict their piano repertoire. However, a lack of biomechanical data exists to support whether reduced piano key size is effective in achieving this outcome. This research investigates the effect of playing on three different key width size pianos (5.5-inch octave, 6.0-inch octave and conventional size with 6.5-inch octave) on hand, arm and shoulder muscle activity levels according to the hand size of the pianists. Results indicate that piano key size affects the muscle activity levels of selected muscles. Furthermore, this effect of different key sizes changed according to the playersâ?? hand spans.

"Slips, trips, and falls (STFs) are the second leading cause of non-fatal injuries and can lead to fatal incidents in the mining industry. Hazard identification is an essential first step in remediating STF hazards and creating a safer work environment. Previous research has identified industry-specific risk factors for STFs, evaluated exposures to those risk factors, and developed taxonomies of the hazards for the construction and farming sectors. In comparison, ErgoMineâ??a mobile device application-based ergonomics audit toolâ??is the only systematic evaluation tool that covers STF hazards in the mining industry. However, ErgoMine was not specifically developed to address STF hazards. This paper describes the development of a taxonomy that helps identify STF hazards at surface mining sites and provides recommendations to address these hazards to inform future evaluation tools. The objective was to develop a taxonomy that was self-explanatory, observable, repeatable, and solution oriented. In addition to current regulations, standards and guidelines were used to develop the taxonomy to ensure the focus was beyond basic compliance. A detailed description of how the STF hazard taxonomy was created for walkways, stairways, and fixed ladders is provided, along with two specific applications of its use. The STF hazard taxonomy can be used to develop tools like checklists and ergonomics audits to identify and remediate slip, trip, and fall hazards at surface mining facilities, thereby improving worker safety.","Slip, Trip, Fall, Taxonomy, Standards, Checklist, Audit, Mining",Mahiyar F.

"Auditory alarms offer great potential for facilitating human-computer interactions in complex, rapidly changing environments. They are particularly useful in medical settings, where in theory they should afford communication in emergency rooms, operating theatres, and hospitals around the world. Unfortunately, the sounds typically used in these devices are problematic, and researchers have documented numerous shortcomings. Their ubiquity means that even incremental improvements can have significant benefits for patient care. However, solutions have proven challenging for multiple reasonsâ??including issues of backward compatibility inherent in changing any standard. Here we present a series of three experiments showing that manipulations to one specific, understudied property can significantly lower alarm annoyance without harming learning or memoryâ??while preserving an alarm's melodic and rhythmic structure. These results suggest promising new directions for improving the hospital's soundscape, where evidence of problems related to sound are increasingly recognized as affecting medical outcomes as well as physician well-being.","Human-computer interface design, Alarm annoyance, Amplitude envelope, Modifiable risk factors",Sharmila Sreetharan and Joseph J.

"This study investigated the effects of target size and error rate on cognitive demand during augmented reality (AR) interactions. In a repeated-measures laboratory study, twenty participants performed two AR tasks (omni-directional pointing and cube placing) with different target sizes and error rates. During the AR tasks, we measured cerebral oxygenation using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), perceived workload using the NASA-TLX questionnaire, stress using the Short Stress State Questionnaire, and task performance (task completion time). The results showed that the AR tasks with more interaction errors increased cerebral oxygenation, perceived workload, and task completion time while the target size significantly affected physical demand and task completion time. These results suggest that appropriate target sizes and low system errors may reduce potential cognitive demand in AR interactions.","Functional near infrared spectroscopy, NASA task Load index, Computer human interaction, Usability, Cerebral oxygenation",Kiana Kia and Jaejin Hwang and In-Sop Kim and Hakim Ishak and Jeong Ho Kim,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001496,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103502,0003-6870,2021,103502,97,Applied Ergonomics,The effects of target size and error rate on the cognitive demand and stress during augmented reality interactions,article,KIA2021103502
"Industrial passive low-back exoskeletons have gained recent attention as ergonomic interventions to manual handling tasks. This research utilized a two-armed experimental approach (single vs dual-task paradigms) to quantify neural and biomechanical tradeoffs associated with short-term human-exoskeleton interaction (HEI) during asymmetrical lifting in twelve healthy adults balanced by gender. A dynamic, electromyography-assisted spine model was employed that indicated statistical, but marginal, biomechanical benefits of the tested exoskeleton, which diminished with the introduction of the cognitive dual-task. Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based brain connectivity analyses, we found that the tested exoskeleton imposed greater neurocognitive and motor adaptation efforts by engaging action monitoring and error processing brain networks. Collectively, these findings indicate that a wearer's biomechanical response to increased cognitive demands in the workplace may offset the mechanical advantages of exoskeletons. We also demonstrate the utility of ambulatory fNIRS to capture the neural cost of HEI without the need for elaborate dual-task manipulations.","Spinal load, Brain activity, Human-robot interaction, Neuroergonomics, Manual handling",Yibo Zhu and Eric B.

"Manual harvesting is still prevalent in the agricultural industry. Accordingly, it is one of the largest contributors toward work-related musculoskeletal disorder. The cutting task in oil palm harvesting uses a long pole and involves repetitive and forceful motion of the upper limbs. Exoskeleton technology is increasingly explored to assist manual tasks performance in manufacturing and heavy industries, mainly for reducing discomfort and injuries, and improving productivity. This paper reports an initial investigation on the feasibility of using an upper limb exoskeleton to assist oil palm harvesting tasks.Â Previous studies highlighted that exoskeletons for agricultural activities should be adaptable to changing field tasks, tools and equipment. The immediate difference in the activity of three muscles were analyzed for a range of harvesting-simulated tasks. Lower activities were observed for tasks involving overhead work when using the prototype. Nevertheless, usersâ?? feedback highlighted that its design should be optimized for better acceptance.","Wearable, Agriculture, EMG, Exoskeleton",Hazreen H.

"Many anti-vibration gloves are available in the market but there are lacks of understanding of their effectiveness in facilitating various hand movements. This study addresses the knowledge gap through a wear trial with five types of anti-vibration gloves made of chloroprene rubber and spacer fabric. Surface electromyography of three forearm muscles of 16 male subjects was conducted during gripping, key pinching, woodblock transporting, screw inserting and screw driving tasks. The correlation between the compression properties of the gloves and hand performance was also evaluated. The results show that hand dexterity is inhibited and more muscle activity is needed to carry the woodblocks with the spacer fabric glove without special design features. A thicker glove can reduce the demand of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle when using an impact driver. A thinner dorsal side and tailored padding can enhance hand dexterity. The findings can be used as a reference for designing anti-vibration gloves.","Anti-vibration gloves, Spacer fabric, Hand performance, Wear trials, EMG, Muscle activity",Annie Yu and Sachiko Sukigara,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002192,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103572,0003-6870,2022,103572,98,Applied Ergonomics,Evaluation of the design and materials of anti-vibration gloves: Impact on hand dexterity and forearm muscle activity,article,YU2022103572
"Musculoskeletal models may enhance our understanding of the dynamic loading of the joints during manual material handling. This study used state-of-the-art musculoskeletal models to determine the effects of load mass, asymmetry angle, horizontal location and deposit height on the dynamic loading of the knees, shoulders and lumbar spine during lifting. Recommended weight limits and lifting indices were also calculated using the NIOSH lifting equation. Based on 1832 lifts from 22 subjects, we found that load mass had the most substantial effect on L5-S1 compression. Increments in asymmetry led to large increases in mediolateral shear, while load mass and asymmetry had significant effects on anteroposterior shear. Increased deposit height led to higher shoulder forces, while the horizontal location mostly affected the forces in the knees and shoulders. These results generally support the findings of previous research, but notable differences in the trends and magnitudes of the estimated forces were observed.","Computer simulation, Musculoskeletal system, Occupational injuries",Sebastian Skals and RÃºni BlÃ¡foss and Mark {de Zee} and Lars Louis Andersen and Michael Skipper Andersen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001381,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103491,0003-6870,2021,103491,96,Applied Ergonomics,"Effects of load mass and position on the dynamic loading of the knees, shoulders and lumbar spine during lifting: a musculoskeletal modelling approach",article,SKALS2021103491
"Certain font features (e.g., letter width) can change the amount of space occupied by text in published works. Font styles/features are also known to affect reading eye movements (EM); however, few studies have examined these effects â?? and none used high-resolution displays. We examined the effects of font width on EMs by utilizing four fonts, from the Univers family, which varied in letter-width magnitude. Participantsâ?? (nÂ =Â 25) reading speed, saccade velocity, and the duration/number of fixations and saccades were recorded. The Ultra Condensed font significantly influenced readability and yielded: fewer fixations and saccades; longer fixation durations than the Roman and Extended fonts; and shorter saccade durations, relative to the other fonts. Readers efficiently adjusted their EMs such that no reading-speed differences were observed. The eye-tracking metrics revealed two trade-off effects: (1) fewer and shorter EMs and (2) more and longer EMs, which were revealed by the font-width manipulation.","Letter width, Font, Typography, Reading, Eye movements",Katsumi Minakata and Sofie Beier,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001708,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103523,0003-6870,2021,103523,97,Applied Ergonomics,The effect of font width on eye movements during reading,article,MINAKATA2021103523
"The recent rise of virtual reality technology has led researchers to investigate how to adapt transitions to virtual environments.

"Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders of the Upper Limbs (WRMSDs-ULs) are one of the most common occupational diseases worldwide. Repetitive motion is one of the main risk factors associated with these conditions. Several efforts have been made within the scientific community in order to develop specific methods to assess the risk that repetitive work represents. Furthermore, internationally coordinated work has resulted in the generation of a series of ISO standards to address issues around ergonomics in the workplace. In 2012, Chile adopted the ISO11228-3 standard checklist in its regulatory process, creating the first technical standard of risk management for repetitive motion. The aim of this study is to present the results of a nation-wide online survey of Chilean Health and Safety Practitioners and Ergonomists, which was conducted in order to identify their level of application experience, most commonly adopted practices, and opinions on the first Chilean Standard for WRMSDs-ULs risk assessment. A second aim is to discuss common issues and possible improvements in public policies, and the adoption of international instruments by developing countries. A total of 331 respondents completed the survey (183 Ergonomists and 148 non-ergonomist). It was observed that a number of the participants consider that the adaptation of the ISO standard has several issues, ranging from simple ones as wording and format to more complex ones regarding overall structure, logic, and ease of use. One of the main issues expressed is the fact that during the adaptation process the instrument is applied in multitask jobs, without providing clear instructions or training. Furthermore, among the top three most used assessment methods were RULA and REBA, which are posture-driven, instead of methods validated for repetitive motion. The issues detected by the Chilean OHS practitioners are common in developing countries, where an intersection of lack of resources, public agency authoritarianism, and poor communication between public-private and public-public organizations contribute to poor consultation, validation, and adaptation processes. Suggestions to improve the current Chilean standard, as well as considerations for developing countries, are presented.","Upper-extremity, Risk assessment, Prevention, Repetitive strain injury",HÃ©ctor Ignacio Castellucci and Carlos Viviani and Paulina HernÃ¡ndez and Gonzalo Bravo and Marta MartÃ­nez and Jaime Ibacache and Ãngelo Bartsch,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001307,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103483,0003-6870,2021,103483,96,Applied Ergonomics,Developing countries and the use of ISO Standard 11228-3 for risk management of Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders of the Upper Limbs (WRMSDs-ULs): The case of Chile,article,CASTELLUCCI2021103483
"Objectives The aim of this study was to assess current perceptions of heat stress, fatigue and recovery practices during active duty in Australian firefighters. Design Prospective survey. Methods 473 firefighters from Fire and Rescue New South Wales completed a two-part, 16-item survey. Questions included perceptions of the operational activities and body areas associated with the most heat stress, the most mentally and physically demanding activities, and levels of fatigue felt. Further questions focussed on the use and importance of recovery practices, effectiveness of currently used heat-mitigation strategies and additional cooling strategies for future use. Results Around a third of firefighters (62%) reported structural fire-fighting as the hottest operational activities experienced, followed by bushfire-fighting (51%) and rescue operations (38%). The top three responses for which body-parts get the hottest ranked as â??the headâ?? (58%), â??the whole bodyâ?? (54%) and â??the upper backâ?? (40%), respectively. The majority of firefighters (~90%) stated they always or sometimes use the opportunity to recover at an incident, with the top three being â??sit in the shadeâ?? (93%), â??cold water ingestion (drinking)â?? (90%) and â??removing your helmet, flash hood and jacketâ?? (89%). Firefighters reported higher usefulness for more easily deployed strategies compared to more advanced strategies. Limited age and gender differences were found, although location of active service differences were present. Conclusion These findings may inform future research, and translation to operational directives for recovery interventions; including exploration of protective gear and clothing, education, resources and provision of cooling methods, as well as recovery aid development.","Occupational health, Safety, Survey, Demands, Physiology",Hugh H.K.

Caregivers who work in the home environment are at risk of back injury due to the awkward postures they have to adopt while providing care. Real-time biofeedback provided by a recently developed wearable device (PostureCoach) may be able to reduce this risk. The effectiveness of a two-day training intervention (including PostureCoach and an educational video) was evaluated for its ability to decrease the amount of time spent in end-range spine flexion. Twenty novice caregivers repeated a series of simulated care tasks. Real-time auditory biofeedback was provided to the intervention group (nÂ =Â 10) when participantsâ?? sagittal lumbar spine flexion exceeded a preset threshold during training trials. Participants in the control group (nÂ =Â 10) received no feedback. Participants repeated the tasks again two weeks and two months post-intervention.

Results were analyzed using thematic qualitative analysis. Sociotechnical systems modeling illustrates the complexity of designing interventions for emergency medicine that affect multiple patients, providers, work systems, technologies, and processes. The post work systems model illustrates that several elements in the external ED environment can affect the effectiveness of the intervention.

"Falling injuries pose serious health risks to people of all ages, and knowing the extent of exposure to irregular surfaces will increase the ability to measure fall risk. Current gait analysis methods require overly complicated instrumentation and have not been tested for external factors such as walking surfaces that are encountered in the real-world, thus the results are difficult to extrapolate to real-world situations. Artificial intelligence approaches (in particular deep learning networks of varied architectures) to analyze data collected from wearable sensors were used to identify irregular surface exposure in a real-world setting. Thirty young adults wore six Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors placed on their body (right wrist, trunks at the L5/S1 level, left and right thigh, left and right shank) while walking over eight different surfaces commonly encountered in the living community as well as occupational settings. Three variations of deep learning models were trained to solve this walking surface recognition problem: 1) convolution neural network (CNN); 2) long short term memory (LSTM) network and 3) LSTM structure with an extra global pooling layer (Global-LSTM) which learns the coordination between different data streams (e.g. different channels of the same sensor as well as different sensors). Results indicated that all three deep learning models can recognize walking surfaces with above 0.90 accuracy, with the Global-LSTM yielding the best performance at 0.92 accuracy. In terms of individual sensors, the right thigh based Global-LSTM model reported the highest accuracy (0.90 accuracy). Results from this study provide further evidence that deep learning and wearable sensors can be utilized to recognize irregular walking surfaces induced motion alteration and applied to prevent falling injuries.","Uneven surface, Gait, Convolutional neural network, Inertial measurement units, Artificial intelligence",B.

"Workplace temperature screening has become standard practice during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The objective was to determine the consistency of four temperature devices during exposure to simulated and actual environmental conditions reflective of a workplace. An infrared (IR) digital thermometer (accuracy(A)Â±0.2), IR laser thermometer (AÂ±1), and thermal imaging camera (AÂ±0.3) were used to measure forehead and tympanic (digital only) temperatures. The first experiment was conducted in a controlled simulated environment (â??20 to 20Â Â°C) with three participants (32-YOF, 27-YOM, 20-YOF).

"Worker posture, task time and performance are often affected when one-handed manual dexterous tasks are performed in small overhead spaces under an obscured view. A common method used for supplementing visual feedback in these cases is a hand-held telescopic mirror, but that involves working with both arms extended overhead, and is often accompanied by awkward neck and shoulder postures. A video camera was considered as an alternative to using a mirror for visual feedback and reducing overhead reach. A mirror, a borescope and an omnidirectional camera were evaluated while laboratory participants performed three one-handed simulated manufacturing tasks in a small overhead enclosure. Videos were recorded for quantifying the time that postures were assumed while performing the tasks. The average time that both arms were above mid-shoulder height for the omnidirectional camera was more than 2.5 times less than for the mirror and borescope. The average proportion of neck strain time was 0.01% (or less) for both the omnidirectional camera and the borescope, compared to 83.68% for the mirror. No significant differences were observed in task completion times between the three modalities. Hence, an omnidirectional camera can provide visibility while reducing straining postures for manufacturing operations involving overhead work.","Visibility modalities, Telescopic mirror, Borescope, Omnidirectional camera, Musculoskeletal disorders",Prajna Bhat and Emmanuel Senft and Michael Zinn and Michael Gleicher and Bilge Mutlu and Rebecca Cook and Robert G.

"Scenario-based warnings for road safety can be provided in the environment of intelligent connected vehicles via Bluetooth earphones or smart wristbands; designing an optimal means of presentation to drivers is an important point of consideration. Vibration warnings have been widely studied owing to their unique benefits. This experimental study aims to identify suitable body parts for vibration warnings during driving. The independent variables were the vibration position (three levels of stimulus, i.e., wrist, shin, and upper jaw) and response effector (two levels, i.e., hand and foot). Experiment Tasks 1 and 2 measured participantsâ?? simple reaction time and choice reaction time, respectively, when providing vibration warnings in non-driving situations. The results demonstrate that the vibration on the upper jaw has the shortest simple reaction time and choice reaction time. The effect of stimulus-response consistency on choice reaction time was insignificant. Task 3 was similar to Task 2, with the exception of simulated driving. Compared to the result in Task 2, the choice reaction time in Task 3 was approximately 200Â ms longer. Vibration of the upper jaw was reported to have the highest perceived intensity and preference. Based on the study results, the design implications for wearable vibration warnings of collision avoidance systems are presented","Vibration warnings, Vibration positions, Response effector, Choice reaction time, Stimulus-response compatibility, Connected vehicles",Jingyue Zheng and Tingru Zhang and Liang Ma and Yulun Wu and Wei Zhang,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702100137X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103490,0003-6870,2021,103490,96,Applied Ergonomics,Vibration warning design for reaction time reduction under the environment of intelligent connected vehicles,article,ZHENG2021103490
"Step ladders are commonly found in homes and are used for a variety of tasks. While ladders are often associated with fall-related injuries, other accident modes that do not result in a fall can be observed in real-world data. In this study, the available data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database involving step ladder-related injuries was supplemented by a biomechanical consideration of kinematics and injury mechanism to further understand accident modes and injury patterns. Results of this study demonstrated that the most common accident mode was falling (91%), followed by non-fall errors in execution of intended kinematics (non-fall execution errors) (4%) and pinching (1%). Falls were commonly associated with fractures, non-fall execution errors were commonly associated with a strain or sprain, while pinches were commonly associated with lacerations. The results of this study show that during step ladder use in a non-occupational setting, the accident mode is associated with an injury pattern.","Ladder, Injury, Epidemiology, Portable ladders",Elizabeth A. {Rapp van Roden} and Juff George and Laurene T.

"Motor development was investigated in 114 children aged 4â??9 years, and the effects of different cross-sectional shapes of chopsticks (octagonal, square, and triangular) on manipulation ability were examined. Children's chopstick manipulation was found to be related to the developmental stage and their way of holding them. Manipulation was enhanced when they transmitted the optimal force to the tips when closing, the bottom chopstick was stabilized when opening, and the upper chopstick was encouraged to rotate moderately. In addition, opening chopsticks is more difficult than closing them. Square chopsticks increase the force of the tips, whereas octagonal chopsticks encourage more rotation of the upper chopstick, indicating that differences in the ability to manipulate chopsticks during development affect the preference for cross-sectional shapes. We plan to examine the effectiveness of chopsticks with different cross-sectional shapes of the upper and bottom chopsticks by focusing on the opening operation.","Children, Motor development, Chopsticks",Yuko Kaneko Yokubo and Tetsuo Ota and Katsuyuki Shibata,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000368702100154X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103507,0003-6870,2021,103507,97,Applied Ergonomics,Relationship between chopstick manipulation and cross-sectional shape in the developmental stages from infancy to early school age,article,YOKUBO2021103507
"Background Effective shooting performance relies heavily on sufficient grip strength. However, some standard issue pistols used by police services may have a trigger weight that causes problems for officers with insufficient grip strength, including female officers. The current study aimed to replicate previous findings, which show that grip strength is positively related to shooting performance. We also sought to determine what grip strength is required to achieve proficient scores on a standard police pistol qualification (PPQ) when a heavy trigger weight (i.e., 8lbsâ??12lbs) is used. Finally, we explored the relationship between officer gender and PPQ scores to determine if grip strength plays a mediating role in this relationship. Method The dominant hand grip strength (in lbs) of 86 male and 32 female officers were recorded prior to their participation in their agency mandated annual PPQ. Officer gender, grip strength, and PPQ scores were analyzed to explore how they related to one another. Results Grip strength significantly impacted officersâ?? ability to pass the PPQ, with female officers possessing lower grip strength compared to male officers, as well as achieving poorer scores on the PPQ. We determined that grip strengths in the range of 80lbs and 125lbs were needed to score approximately 85Â % and 90Â % on the PPQ, respectively; exceeding that of the average grip strength for the female officers in the study (MÂ =Â 77.5lbs). Mediation analysis suggested that grip strength may mediate the relationship between officer gender and shooting performance, but studies with more power are needed to confirm that. Conclusion To improve shooting performance as well as public and police safety, law enforcement agencies may need to consider including grip strength training in their conditioning regime or examine the adoption pistols with a lighter trigger pull weight (e.g., 6lbs).","Shooting performance, Grip strength, Trigger pull weight, Pistol",Andrew Brown and Simon Baldwin and Brittany Blaskovits and Craig Bennell,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001836,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103536,0003-6870,2021,103536,97,Applied Ergonomics,Examining the impact of grip strength and officer gender on shooting performance,article,BROWN2021103536
"Measurement of pressure threshold has found its applications in the fields of medical sciences and product design. Hence it has been a profound area of research interest for several decades. However, hardly any detailed investigation has been undertaken to measure the pressure threshold in the head region. In this study, Pressure Discomfort Threshold (PDT) and Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) were measured for two hundred eighteen healthy Chinese adults at seventy-six anatomical locations, and further statistical analyses were performed on the acquired data to understand the relationship between different demographic parameters. The results suggest that the pressure sensitivity is low in the vertex region, moderate in the forehead and temporal area, and high in the facial and nasal region. From this study, pressure sensitivity maps were developed for PDT and PPT for Chinese adults. The measured pressure threshold data showed no significant relationship with age and Body Mass Index (BMI).","Human head, Pressure threshold, Pressure sensitivity maps",Parth Shah and Yan Luximon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001952,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103548,0003-6870,2021,103548,97,Applied Ergonomics,Assessment of pressure sensitivity in the head region for Chinese adults,article,SHAH2021103548
"The purpose of this study was to evaluate anthropometry and forearm muscle activity as predictors of maximal isometric wrist torque. Thirteen anthropometric measures, forearm electromyography from flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR), and maximal isometric wrist flexion/extension torque were obtained from 25 male participants. Pearson correlation coefficients assessed relationships between peak isometric torque and: (1) anthropometrics, (2) FCR and ECR activation, (3) FCR/ECR antagonist/agonist coactivation ratios. Based on significant correlations, linear regression equations were developed (SPSS v.25; pÂ <Â 0.05). Hand thickness, forearm circumference and ECR activation or hand thickness, elbow circumference, FCR activation and body weight were most highly correlated with extension or flexion torque, respectively. Hand thickness, forearm circumference, and ECR activation (R2Â =Â 54.5%; pÂ =Â 0.001) and hand thickness, elbow circumference, FCR activation (R2Â =Â 68.3%; pÂ <Â 0.001) explained similar variance in torque regressions as did the addition of body weight to extension (R2Â =Â 58.0%; pÂ =Â 0.001) and flexion (R2Â =Â 69.9%; pÂ <Â 0.001) torque regression equations, respectively. Circumference measurements, a pseudo for muscle size, and activation amplitude influenced wrist force output more than limb length or coactivation.","Wrist strength, Workplace evaluation, Forearm EMG",Nicole J.

"Practice guidelines can facilitate the translation of evidence-based knowledge into better occupational health and safety (OHS) prevention. This paper describes the development process, findings and content of a practice and evidence-based guideline for musculoskeletal pain (MSP) to OHS professionals in Denmark. We used a participatory process with involvement of more than 100 OHS professionals in the development of the guideline. The guideline contains three sections: 1) Rapid review of risk factors for MSP (Push/pull, Screen work, Lifting, Awkward postures and Psychosocial factors related to MSP) and single- and multi-stranded interventions targeting MSP. 2) Process recommendations for use of the guideline by a three-phase participatory process 3) Practical recommendations that contain advice and methods for the three-phase participatory process. This paper can promote future guideline development, as it provides specific insight into how OHS professionals can be included in the development of practice and evidence-based guideline through a participatory process.","Occupational health and safety, Guideline, Musculoskeletal pain",Kathrine Greby Schmidt and Andreas Holtermann and Marie Birk JÃ¸rgensen and Malene Jagd Svendsen and Charlotte Diana NÃ¸rregaard Rasmussen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021001678,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103520,0003-6870,2021,103520,97,Applied Ergonomics,Developing a practice and evidence-based guideline for occupational health and safety professionals to prevent and handle musculoskeletal pain in workplaces,article,SCHMIDT2021103520
"This study assessed the influence of different types of flooring on infants' crawling motion patterns and performance. Each participating infant (range: 8.7-12.4 months) was encouraged to crawl on a tatami mat made of woven straw as well as other flooring types such as hardwood, carpet, and joint mat. Material tests were conducted to quantify the friction and shock absorption of the flooring. A three-dimensional motion capture system was used to measure spatiotemporal and kinematic variables during hands-and-knees crawling. An increased crawling rate was associated with a faster cadence of cyclic arm movements, but not with crawling stride length. Hardwood flooring had a significantly lower crawling rate and longer duration of hand-floor contact than tatami, while the crawling stride length and range of motion of joint movements were hardly affected by flooring type. The results of this study suggest a drawback of hardwood flooring in terms of infantsâ?? effective quadrupedal locomotion.","Crawling motion, Flooring, 3D motion capture",Jeewon Choi and Takeru Ogawa and Shin Takesue and Satoshi Muraki and Youki Inoue and Hikari Abe and Emi Yamanoi,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103553,0003-6870,2022,103553,98,Applied Ergonomics,Different flooring surfaces affect infantsâ?? crawling performance,article,CHOI2022103553
